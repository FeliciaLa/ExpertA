    "content": "Are other unis in the UK selling themselves to a specific country/nationality so explicitly? I understand that international students are a major source of income for many, if not most, UK universities, especially after Brexit. However, I was still surprised by some of the things I experienced at UCL: - Large number of Chinese-speaking students: It feels like at least 40% of UCL students are from China. At the student centre, it sometimes feels like that number exceeds 80%. It‚Äôs not uncommon for me to be one of the few non-Chinese students there (hats off to them who study hard and make great use of university facilities. I try to do the same üòÇ) - Lecture halls named after Chinese donors: I noticed some lecture halls named after Chinese families or labeled with titles like Hong Kong Alumni. - Job fairs exclusively for Chinese students: this was the most surprising. Why are there job fairs only for Chinese students? Why not similar opportunities for Indian students or others, who also make up a large portion of the international student population? For the record, I‚Äôm not from India. What really saddened me, though, was seeing some students using apps on their tablets that transcribed and translated lectures in real time into Chinese. It made me wonder if they took the IELTS and met the minimum English requirements, or at least attended the university‚Äôs pre-sessional English courses. All this situation has raised questions in my mind about whether UCL might be lowering its admissions standards (informally/behind closed doors) to accept more full-fee-paying students, regardless of their readiness to study in an English-speaking academic environment. I get that China has a massive population, which could naturally lead to more Chinese students abroad, but I still feel like there‚Äôs something more going on here. Any thoughts or similar experiences?",

    "content": "My friends decided that I shouldn‚Äôt get first pick in my uni home after finding the house and sorting everything out. Am I overreacting? We had left finding a house too late and it got to around March/ April without one. We were looking for a home for 10 people yet no one was stepping up to do any work to find one so I decided to look for it myself. I found a house and went back and fourth with the landlords for months discussing the property. As well as this I was the one who was chased everyone up for details, analysing the contract and finalising the whole ordeal. I had mentioned to around 6 of my friends that are supposed to be living with me (those that I already lived with last year) that I want first pick for this and they agreed. However today they decided the rooms by using a random spinner in a call I wasn‚Äôt able to attend because I was celebrating my birthday and all ‚Äúunanimously‚Äù decided that I shouldn‚Äôt get first pick despite 6 of them agreeing to my face that I should. My name was then put in the spinner and I ended up getting one of the smallest rooms in the house. I consider these people my close friends and I was hurt that they decided to switch up when it favoured them after months of agreeing on me having the first pick The other 4 flatmates ( the ones I didn‚Äôt directly mention getting first pick to )stated ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not what they did in their old house‚Äù when me getting first pick was suggested however their house had rooms of similar sizes. I kinda lashed out at the whole situation. Am I in the wrong or is it fair?",

I'm now being told I MUST pay this back despite this being their personal mistake? I was told by my student union that me having intermittent a few months might cause them to ask for a loan payment back if it was given after I paused studies, but this isn't the case. They have explicitly told me that they have overpayed me. Why am I being held liable for their mistake? I don't understand why my entitled amount has gone down either. I live away from home, I can't find employment, I have no investments, my family don't meet the financial threshold, I deserved that higher payment as far as I'm concerned.",

    "content": "My advice to freshers to make friends I just graduated. 4 years and honestly, university on a social and personal development level was the best decision of my life (financially is another conversation lol) I was a kid in school who was bullied a lot. I was awkward, still am sometimes really and dealt with a lot of social skill issues and going to uni was one of the scariest things ever but it paid off completely. I see a lot of people on here and on social media talk about their negative experiences and facing and dealing with loneliness and unfortunate struggles of not making friends. It‚Äôs terrible and it leads to people even abandoning uni entirely. I want to share the lessons I have learned to give back. Here‚Äôs how you make friends and combat loneliness at uni. 1. **You NEED to put yourself out there**-You probably hear this one a lot and for some, I can already feel the eyes rolling reading it because yeah, no shit and I have put myself out there and it didn‚Äôt work. However, I hate to sound like this but a lot of the time I don‚Äôt believe they fully did. It‚Äôs scary, it really fucking is but if you want to meet people, you have to leave your room and go to all your lectures and seminars, make small talk with people in your class. You need to go to society and club taster sessions and join and TALK. You need to go to these flat parties that are open invite and not be afraid to stick out and stand alone sometimes. Don‚Äôt want to drink? That‚Äôs fine, your uni should promote sober events. Oh did you grab the number or insta of someone in your class, message them, they don‚Äôt reply, cool, move on, there‚Äôs other people. You can‚Äôt dwell on negative social experiences and stop them from letting you make these connections. It‚Äôs so scary, I know but it‚Äôs your life. 2. **You have to be self aware**-Another thing I notice is that people respond to the first point and say I did all of that and still made no friends. Okay, good job, proud of you genuinely. But I‚Äôm going to be so deadass and blunt. How were you acting? I‚Äôm not at all saying don‚Äôt be you but to create friendships, especially in large social settings, you have to read the room. This is difficult especially for people with neurodivergent backgrounds but the fact of the matter is, even in a neurodivergent community you meet at uni, there‚Äôs still an element of being aware of what you say and do as it can negatively affect you. Be a good listener, talk about collective interests, know the humour of a group before making jokes which may or may not land. 3. **Your personal time is just as valuable as your social time**-We are social animals so of course we crave and desire relationships with others and making friends is an important part of it. At uni, it feels like a be all and end all but the fact is, your own time alone is just as important. It‚Äôs okay to sit in your room alone for a day just studying, watching TV, doing any of your hobbies, don‚Äôt fall into the mindset that being alone is damaging and upsetting as it doesn‚Äôt have to. If you can‚Äôt be comfortable on your own sometimes, then you‚Äôre gonna fall into unhealthy relationships with people and making friends. 4. **It‚Äôs better to have 4 quarters than 100 cents**-This quote basically says it‚Äôs better to have 4 good close friends than 100 acquaintances. Don‚Äôt prioritise numbers. Don‚Äôt stretch yourself thin. If you make just one friend, just make sure you maintain it and build it. Sure, everyone wants to throw a house party with everyone in uni but would you rather stand around and talk to people you barely know or, watch a movie with some friends at home and have some good and rewarding talks. 5. **Have some fun for gods sakes**-Step out of your comfort zone. Don‚Äôt be afraid to look like a fool, your positive energy, the way you have fun is what attracts others. Like I said, you should be self aware but I‚Äôm not saying you should deny yourself of having fun entirely. If someone says we should all go to river and have a swim, put your feet in at least. If someone wants to walk to Tesco at 3am and you‚Äôre awake, join them if they offer. Have that extra shot in the club, you are young, enjoy yourself. That‚Äôs what attracts people to be your friend. 6. **There is a world outside of uni**-I think a lot of people restrict themselves to just their year group in their uni. You‚Äôre in a brand new city, explore for gods sakes. When I moved to my uni town, I joined a martial arts club in the city unaffiliated with the uni just to meet new people. Go to a pub and get a drink by yourself, talk to the bartenders, just don‚Äôt be weird. If you have a positive energy, people will approach you or maybe you should approach them. Expand your options. 7. **Don‚Äôt act all high and mighty**-This doesn‚Äôt apply to everyone (I hope) but I have witnessed and met a lot of people who‚Äôs standards for who they make friends with is insanely high. I‚Äôm not talking politics, I‚Äôm talking just basic interests. People not hanging out with others cause they don‚Äôt go out clubbing or vice versa. People who don‚Äôt want to hang out with people too sporty or people who are too reserved and artsy. Get the hell off your high horse and learn to interact with people who are different than you. 8. **The unfortunate reality is, sometimes it‚Äôs just luck**-This is one of those points where I think a lot of people don‚Äôt want to acknowledge it because it destroys a lot of advice people have in friendmaking and maybe it‚Äôs just me but in my opinion and from what I have seen, making friends can just be plain luck. Everyone you interact with has their own lives which has butterfly effects on everyone around you. Sometimes things just don‚Äôt work out. Sometimes it takes longer than everyone else. Sometimes it feels like you‚Äôre cursed and others are blessed. You combat this feeling of defeat by acknowledging and recognising you have clear potential to be a good mate, it just didn‚Äôt play out just yet. Maybe you‚Äôll be lonely in first year, second year. But be patient. In third year maybe, you‚Äôll find that group or that person. All of these weren‚Äôt realised the minute I got to uni but through 4 years of learning and making mistakes. But I can honestly say now, I am proud of the person I have become and the friends I have made is a big reason I have socially become a better person. You will be fine, I promise.",

The situation is my girlfriend is in london and it might jeporadise our relationship if i move to Wales, but if i were to join London Met, I'd have to do 2 more years in college for another qualification, as i only have 1 A-Level equivalent. Is there any relocation help in terms of moving to london to become a police officer or for accomodation help with education so i can be closer to my girlfriend whilst working in the biggest police force in the UK? Or do i bite the bullet and move to North Wales, where theres no financial risk for me? I'm located in the West Midlands but alot of my family has moved and I don't want to live here anymore.

Any help at all would be appreciated.\" In summary, I've come to this subreddit to see if theres anything i can do about getting support whilst attaining a level 3 qualification in public service. I want to study at NESCOT for this, and what costs would there be for accommodation, or what support i can get. I don't have any money saved up to help, but this is something i really want to pursue.

I feel like I was not emotionally prepared or mature to handle it. I don't feel like I achieved my academic potential. I graduated with 2.2 even though I would get firsts regularly but I essentially had a breakdown and did not show up for my exams which pulled it down to 2.2. I knew even at that time that I was not mentally well in my final year but I was pressured by everyone to just push ahead which was a horrible mistake. If I could go back in time, I would have taken the year off to work on my trauma. Now I am older and more emotionally mature and healthy. I feel excited to go back to uni and study again. Because of my 2.2 it limits a lot masters that I would like to do. I want to prove something to myself. I've worked different jobs since and even went abroad but still the desire to want to go back grows. I am also worried about how to fund it. I've heard mixed things.

Would really appreciate any honest perspectives, from anyone who made it to Oxbridge from a similar background or knows how contextual admissions really work.

I want to do a law and criminology degree and my top 3 unis are York, Edinburgh and Sheffield.

I've gotten my shite together so I'm doing well now but I feel like my GCSE profile is weighing me down. Most unis want you to pass in 5 subjects, so I'm afraid of being flat out rejected. Not to mention the competition in CS and with far better applicants. If anyone has advice or has had a similar situation to me (probably not), I would greatly appreciate that.

    "content": "Can someone advise me on placements I booked a careers appointment obviously, but I'd like to ask older students/graduates too about their expereince, if possible. I'm going into year 2 now, I secured a REALLY good placement for my degree, I'm shocked. This will be for the autumn semester. For spring, I'm going to study abroad, where I can't do any internships on the visa at all. While I have this really good intership, there's also chance for me to do a second one too, which is not really relevant to my degree, but may provide some transferable skills, at least on paper. I'm thinking that if I can't do any placement in Spring, then maybe doing two placements, even if one is significantly less relevant than the other, is better than only having one and then not doing anything for the next 6 months. But then... my CV is already very full and diverse compared to the average student on my year (I think, I don't want to be cocky) but not that relevant to my degree, just a very wide range of skills. And the reason I'm so confident about this less good placement is because I've kind of done those things already, it won't be nothing new, just a big official organisation instead of a small business. So I really don't know if it's worth sacrificing the 10 hours or so of my week for that placement on top of another one. But more experience on CV is always better than just getting a university graduation paper with nothing to back it up. I don't know.... Can anyone, especially someone with experience in applying for jobs, chime in with their opinions?",

    "content": "Just finished my first year of CompSci at a top UK uni and I hated it. Feeling lost and overwhelmed ‚Äì is this normal? Hey everyone, This might be a bit of a long one, but I'm feeling pretty lost after my first year of university and could really use some perspective from people who might have been in a similar boat. TLDR: Finished first year of CS at Aston uni in Birmingham and my mental health/social life is awful. The course feels like a content-cramming exercise with almost no in-person contact (\\~6 hours/week), making it impossible to learn properly or make friends. I'm worried about job prospects and can't even get a retail job for the summer. Wondering if I should switch unis (maybe internationally) or if there's a way to fix my current situation. **The Background** Like the title says, I just completed my first year of Computer Science. In the rankings, it's a great uni which does not require A level maths, and I genuinely enjoy the subject itself. However, the actual experience has been incredibly damaging to my social life and mental health, and I feel completely overwhelmed. **My Problems with the Uni Experience** Insane Workload, Zero Depth: We have two 10-week terms to learn a massive amount of content. In that short time, we covered everything from basic programming and computer systems to full-stack web development. It felt impossible to properly understand anything. I found myself rushing assignments and relying heavily on AI just to meet deadlines, which means I haven't actually learned the material deeply. Almost No On-Campus Time: I have about 6 hours of contact time per week. Out of my six modules, only four had any lessons on campus. The rest were entirely online. This has been devastating for my social life. Empty lessons & A Non-Existent Social Scene: The few in-person tutorials we do have are practically empty. Due to the nature of the course, most students just scan their campus cards for attendance and leave within 10 minutes, presumably because they're unmotivated and only want a good paying job. The handful of students who stay are laser-focused on getting their work done and leaving. **Worries About the 'Real World'** Summer Job Rejections: To try and combat the loneliness over the long summer break, I've applied for part-time jobs everywhere (Tesco, Aldi, Asda, etc.) and have been rejected from all of them. I'm not sure why, but it's not helping my confidence. Future Job Prospects: I watched that TLDR News video, \"Why UK Graduates Can‚Äôt Get Jobs,\" and it's made me seriously anxious. It talks about the UK having one of the highest percentages of overqualified workers in Europe, meaning way more graduates than graduate jobs. The competition seems terrifying. So, What Now? My Potential Options I feel like I'm at a major crossroads and need to make a decision before it's too late. Change University: I'm strongly considering applying to another uni, maybe even internationally (in Europe) where the student experience and job prospects might be better. Continue with my course, but try to make changes: Stick it out here, but I have no idea how to make things better given the structural problems with the course. My Questions for You All: Is this experience normal for UK CS degrees? Is it just a \"grind it out\" culture? Has anyone successfully transferred uni (especially internationally)? What was the process like and was it worth it? For those who stayed in a similar situation, how did you improve it? How did you build a social life and actually learn the content? Am I right to be worried about the UK graduate job market for CS, or is that video overblowing it? Any advice at all would be a massive help. Thanks for reading this wall of text.",

But then I started to worry about being away from my family to international student tuition fees etc. I was feeling bad because I could have studied in Europe for much less money just because I am eu citizen. So out of panic I deferred my course at University of bath to September 2026. I don‚Äôt know if I made a mistake. I know that one year is not a waste, but I am worrying about my future for example if I get an offer to study at Netherlands or Italy, let‚Äôs say. I am afraid that I will lose prestige and don‚Äôt get much opportunities I get from UK university. I am in a situation that I can pay international student fees, but that would be mean that I have to give economically and maybe don‚Äôt have much money left for masters programme. The universities I am planning to apply at Europe is university of Groningen and Padua at italy. I feel like I made a mistake by not going to UK this year and trying out, figuring things on my own even if it did stress me too much for three months and crying constantly. I really don‚Äôt know. And also, I don‚Äôt know if I can email the university and get them to bring me back for this year. + I plan to have my own practice in the future. But my main goal is to go to a good clinical psychology course at UK. for example oxbridge and UCL. I am realllyy worried that Eu unis will decrease my chances to get accepted. Because for example uni of bath has a really good content and also opportunities to do research and work abroad with their placement programme.i dont think eu unis do that. I am stressed",

    "content": "Tell me something odd you observed about your degree or cohort... Recent graduate here (Summer 2025 ü•≥). So, I did a biological course and it was normal to share a large amount of modules with other courses on my degree with just about everyone in our department, but one cohort pretty much did the same degree as us and that was Genetics....I did Biochemistry. They have nearly all the same core modules as us but with more options, but for the first 2 years the options were more limited and we shared practically all our classes unless anybody decided to lean more towards plant biology (and or genetics) which we sadly didn't have much as a choice. At some point in time some of them posed the question if they could have both Biochemistry and Genetics on their award documents since we practically did the same degree to which the department said no and seemed to move to try and make sure the course would be more different in the future. I would forget that some of these people were doing a different degree. We also had a fair amount of genetics and genomics on our course and I wanted to ask the same thing! However, it seemed more necessary for us to do their stuff than them sit through the horrible world of bioenergetics as it had nothing to do with them really. Another oddity, is that our department seemed to see no reason for us to engage with the medical side of things despite it being perfectly possible for people to try and specialise as doctors or attempt to convert to biomedical scientists. I would get Biomedical students asking me if I could help them with something in Clinical Biochemistry and would have to awkwardly make them aware that I don't do any such module. It was truly bizzare. Our degree was also heavy on genomics for some reason but I was glad for the exposure even if it made me inherently lose interest in the main stuff for me degree (which reflected well on my dissertation of course!). For my overall uni, I noticed that many courses didn't have to do a dissertation as well. With someone telling me that the department found that they didn't like the quality of the work submitted so they got rid of them after figurimg that the students would never improve. This is nice to hear as you burn with your own write up. Another thing is our terms are shorter, we start much later and we are done with exams by early June (most people by May), but still have the rest of the term for the rest of June but pay the same as everyone else which puts value for money into question severely (especially for us internationals). Oh, and in 3rd term, you only get a short revision lecture per a module which you normally have less of as you progress through the years and the rest of it is exams, so your 3rd term is actually only about a weeks worth of study if you think about it. Was it like this elsewhere as well? I mean it makes sense to not have lectures, but it means the 3rd term is just dead time and they might as well reduce the fees a bit. Many people even go home during spring term and return only for their exams and are gone by the end of May if not April. Some people don't ever have summer exams, so what are they paying for? What were some odd things you noticed about your degree or how it was delivered?",

I currently have a place in University of Manchester as an international student so as you might imagine, the tuition and other fees are horrible. Yes, I should've known and acknowledged the fees before applying but I've always idealised UK and Oxford (from which I got rejected :DDD). I‚Äôve had a pretty narrow mindset about university prestige, and until recently, I only considered places like Oxford or Harvard because I felt like anything less would make me a failure so I didn't even think of any other countries. Now, I learned that Karolinska Institutet is great for my field (Biomed) and it's free for EU students. Unfortunately, I missed the application deadlines and they don‚Äôt accept late admissions. Therefore my only options are to: \\- go to Manchester for all of the degree \\- go to Manchester for a year and apply to Karolinska from there \\- take a gap year and apply to Karolinska then (but I might be rejected from Karolinska) \\- somehow talk myself into my country's uni I rejected, and take admissions test to Karolinska from there (not sure tho if the credits are transferrable as we don't have biomed degree really (only gene tech)) For context, I really don‚Äôt want to stay in my home country, but the idea of taking on massive debt and draining my family‚Äôs savings terrifies me. On the other hand, Manchester is a solid uni and it seems like a place I'd like. If you were in my situation, what would you do? Have any of you transferred from unis or dealt with something similar?

    "content": "MSBA or MBA Regarding my profile, I have 5 years of work experience in business analysis, but it's a shame that neither my role nor I developed serious analytical skills that will make me competent for high-paying roles. Now I am planning for PG in the UK. As an international student, the fee difference for an MBA and a Master's in Business Analytics is just ¬£ 2,000 - ¬£ 3,000, so it's not like I'm burning a hole in my pocket for the MBA degree. I am very confused about what to choose because I MBA course module looks really good, but it has little to almost no emphasis on Business analytics - in most course modules, it is limited to a concept. As I have no plans to do any other degree any time soon: OPTION 1: one side I feel MBA will be helpful for me maybe not for getting the role but atleast understand managerial roles I will take in my next 10 yrs and I can upskill myself in my lacking business analytical skills and try getting business analytical certifications through sef learning or non-degree methods. OPTION 2: On the other hand I feel I am missing the academic approach to Business Analytics, and a master's degree will help me with more structured learning of Business analytics, and I must just stick to Business analytics. JOB ROLE RESEARCH: I've researched about the future roles I am aiming for: They have literally no emphasis on degree - almost all job roles just say: any business/ science degree and put more emphasis on skills, techologies, professional certifications, relevant projects and suprising even more emphasis on project management/ managerial skills of products/teams within various branches in the company. In this case I will actually benefit more from the MBA cause all the MSBA course modules don't cover much on project management. ADVICE REQUIRED ON: So I really need your advice if it is possible to self-upskill with technologies/certifications and work on business analytics projects without a master's degree in it and opt for MBA. Or should I stick to MSBA? MBA with business Analytics pathway is out of consideration cause none of the universities that fit my budget and ideal location ( decided through cost of living) offer MBA with business analytics pathway 2. Help me pick a uni. My MSBA uni shortlisting considering the tuition I can afford is - Aston Uni, Uni of leicester, Manchester metropolitan, uni of hull & uni of Huddersfield. MBA options: Uni of essex, Uni of East Anglia, Uni of Huddersfield and Coventry Uni. Coventry uni is the only one that offers Business analytics & AI pathway with its MBA, but is it any good because rest of my other MBA options have AMBA & AACSB & CMI accreditions apart from decent mid- uni rankings but Coventry has no accreditions nor I have seen it in any rankings.",

    "content": "American Student Considering European Graduate Programs Hi everyone! I never thought I would be posting this until my recent family vacation to Europe, but lately I have been seriously considering grad school at European universities. What struck me when I got back was how overworked Americans are compared to Europeans, and I really wish the U.S. offered more generous PTO. Vacations are how I recharge and stay productive, which has made me think harder about applying to programs abroad. That said, I am leaning toward London. It is an English-speaking, international city with close proximity to other European countries. I am still job-hunting back in the States, and I think London might offer the best of both worlds: the chance to work hard and actually enjoy some time off. Fun fact is that I studied abroad in the UK and really liked the vibe in London, so I have got some familiarity with the city already. Right now, I am honestly disappointed with my undergrad experience. I did not attend a target school, and the alumni network is very regional (and yes, there are some wild assumptions about the culture in my not-to-be-named area). I recently graduated with a Finance degree (GPA 3.9+/4.0), but the lack of internships has been a big drawback. (On the plus side, I held notable leadership roles during undergrad, and I will be taking temp work if no full-time roles come through.) I am optimistic about the GRE, assuming it is not LSAT-level hard, where I plateaued at an average score. One of my biggest regrets was not realizing how important networking is until the end of junior year. To make it trickier, my school's network is strongest in a region I do not plan to stay in. I originally thought New York or Chicago would suit me best, but Europe has been on my mind a lot more lately. I have looked into programs like the MSc Finance at LSE and the MSc Financial Economics at Oxford, but I am open to other suggestions too! I know European salaries can be lower, but as someone who loves to travel, I really admire the UK's 5+ weeks of PTO. The work-life balance in prestigious European careers honestly looks a lot better than what we typically see in the U.S. Here is where I would love some advice: Do you think grad school in Europe is a smart move if my goal is to expand my network and pivot professionally? My biggest fear is ending up in the same spot I am in now, which is strong academics, but no real job pipeline. I have also heard the visa process can be tough for international students, which is definitely on my radar. If I end up returning to the U.S. (or maybe Canada or Australia, since I am open to new regions) because I cannot secure a job in the UK, how are British degrees typically viewed by American employers? If you have experience or thoughts on these programs, or whether I even seem qualified, I would really appreciate your input. I know a lot more about U.S. law school admissions than European grad programs, so any insight helps. Thanks for reading!",

I got a 2 week extension because I have ADHD and had been dealing with severe burnout and brain fog. In 28 days I started preparing myself to research my topic, 20 days in I got to work and spent everyday in the library up until 4am researching everything meticulously. There were a few days between where my brain was fogged up and I wasn‚Äôt as productive as I could‚Äôve been but I still tried to do some work. I hadn‚Äôt written a single word until i got every piece of information; even when I thought I was done, there was always something I needed to do more research on and I would continue that instead of starting the writing. Then with 4 days left to the deadline I wrote 300 words and couldn‚Äôt do anymore because my brain felt like it was switched off. 2 days before the deadline and I didn‚Äôt do a single thing and I was left feeling horrible and guilty. Then 19 hours before the deadline I locked in and wrote everything down, rewriting and redrafting. I managed to hit the word count and get 9000 words down. Got the mark back and it was a 75 with 2 professors calling it an outstanding piece of work. It wasn‚Äôt perfect but for something written in less than a day it was pretty good. My supervisor also said he would help me if I ever wanted to publish it because there‚Äôs a clear gap in literature that my thesis fills. I managed to get a First Class Honours in my degree overall pulling stunts like this but I do wish I was able to spend more time on my assignments and see what potential I could‚Äôve reached.

    "content": "DHE - value in real terms? I‚Äôve posted a couple times here before. Basically, all is not too well. Due to ADHD and little support for that, I‚Äôve struggled with my final year despite strong grades in years 1 & 2, the size of assignments in final has just been too much. I got one of the 4 modules completed on first attempt, ended up having to retake final year minus that module. This time, I‚Äôve submitted a dissertation and passed 1 of 2 assignments for each of the other 2 modules. Unfortunately I think there‚Äôs a 50/50 chance of my diss passing and the 2 outstanding assignments mean those modules aren‚Äôt complete. Student/disability support are looking into whether I can get an exceptional extension to those deadlines due to my ADHD struggles, but that‚Äôs for 2 assignments. If the dissertation doesn‚Äôt pass, they can‚Äôt extend that one. I could apply for an exceptional 2nd retake of final year and try to get SFE funding and better ADHD support this time but it‚Äôs not guaranteed; and honestly the struggle I‚Äôve had trying to get assignments together over this past year, and ending up not having them ready to submit, or submitting and being told they‚Äôre a strong start but not complete enough to pass, has just been exhausting. I get a sort of fight or flight reaction when I think about redoing it, and I fear flight is winning. I just want uni to be over. My course leader says she‚Äôll be able to offer some advice after the field board in August. She says worst case, they may offer me an alternative qualification. I suspect that would be a diploma of higher education. I don‚Äôt want that, it fails to reflect the quality of work I‚Äôve handed in in my 2nd and final years, but I might not have much choice, it seems. Can anyone advise quite how a diploma of higher ed plays out? Would it be in my degree subject or just a more general one? What‚Äôs it worth - not in credits but what are potential employers likely to think of it? I worry it‚Äôll look poor but hoping I might be wrong? I wanted to look at doing a PGCE and/or teaching, and possibly a masters in Speech and Language Therapy further down the line. I suspect those ambitions might be dead now, I don‚Äôt know what doors would still be open to me if I get a DHE. I have 7 years or so of working at Lidl before uni, I could definitely go back to that but the thought of it is honestly filling me with dread. So I‚Äôm really hoping someone here might be able to tell me truthfully that a diploma of higher ed is actually quite good, or that I can top it back up to a degree later, or just some good news. Cause right now, I feel rock bottom.",

One of their requirements for the application is a 1000-1500 word research proposal on an area of academic discourse, and one of the other main components is a portfolio, alongside other smaller components. I just finished my bachelors in architecture, and I ended up getting a first-class honours. Some notable highlights: I was honoured a regional award for my 3rd year design project and also nominated for a national architecture competition for the same design project. My university where i did my bachelors isn‚Äôt a prestige university, so I am unsure if this would make a difference to Cambridge, or if they focus more on the person. I just wondered if anyone had any advice, architecture or non-architecture related, for my postgrad application? Any mistakes I should avoid or things I should know of? Let me know your thoughts.

I don't know how much since my college has not said anything about results to Access to HE students. I do however have a rough idea since my teachers put the grades into ProPortal, except for my maths teacher. In the email King's sent me, they said that they will hold my offer until more results are available and decide if they will accept or reject me. The problem is that they said it may take to mid-late August. My fear is that if A-levels get their results and get through clearing I won't be able to get a place with the offer or even through clearing as I would have to wait. My tutor said to look at my college's app closer to August to see when we will be getting our results, but everything regarding them has been so vague, with no one being able to give an actual date. Anyways, my question is how likely am I to get into King's with this situation? And should I wait for King's to see if they can offer me a place or go through clearing once I receive my results?",

Apologies in advance and please do let me know if I should try somewhere else. (Very unfamiliar with reddit as well) I am currently a Year 12 student in his summer before Year 13 and I am not sure on what I should study. I am definitely late on the schedule but due to some issues this is what I have to work with. For context, I am studying Physics, Chemistry, Biology. And I do plan on doing Maths as well in whatever way possible. Currently I enjoy Chemistry the most out of all my subjects, Physics follows. In the future, I do want to persue in the field of research and higher education in theoretical physics/chemistry and following the academia path. I dislike Physics in topics such as electricity, circuit, or engineering. I do not mind the maths but I cannot stand circuits. I really enjoy Chemistry in my A-Level. I just love everything about it. Question is: 1) if you were me, would you pick Physics or Chemistry in University? 2) and would you go for a Msci course or Bsc course? TLDR: Year 12 Student, hates A-Level Physics but loves Chemistry. Want to do theoretical physics/chemistry and go for Phd, what course should I pick? Physics or Chemistry? Msci or Bsc?

Don't just say \"I like music\", say what type of music. Don't just say you want \"somewhere nice to eat\", say what type of cuisine you like (or don't like). The more specific you are the better, otherwise you'll just get pointed back to the generic guidebooks, blogs and our wiki. **Tell us your budget** \\- If you're on a budget then tell us what it is and we can bear that in mind when making recommendations. There's no point in us coming up with ideas for things to do and places to eat if they'll clean out your wallet within the first 5 minutes. Saying you want something \"cheap\" isn't really helpful because what's cheap is entirely subjective. **Tell us where you'll be based** \\- Let us know where you'll be staying so that we can give local recommendations. **Asking about hotels or hostels** \\- We have homes here so know very little about what the hotels are like. Look on review websites such as TripAdvisor. However, if you say \"I've been looking at these three hotels. Which do you think is the better location?\" then that's the sort of thing we can answer. **Non-touristy stuff** \\- There are no secret corners where we hide the good stuff from outsiders! This is one of the most written about cities in the world, so when we want to go to a museum, or gallery, go window shopping, or whatever, we look at the same sources as tourists (listings sites, blogs, etc - see front page of the wiki). ^(These weekly posts are scheduled to post each Monday at 00:01.

I was getting off from jubilee line at Bond Street with my baby in the buggy. And definitely struggling to do it with a crowded station and possibly annoyed some commuters and was so nervous. But when you said this to another commuter it really made me feel so much better. I wish I could have said thank you to your face and hugged you. It was my first time travelling alone with my baby in the buggy on the tube so just felt like there are patient people in this world after all..sorry the commuter was extremely rude to you afterwards. The words were like music to me in my panicky moment and I want to really say thank you. EDIT: okay this post blew up and I'm so thankful to everyone who was considerate in comments. And also I have to answer a few questions lol. 1. Why was I traveling at peak hour? I actually had to get to other side of the city but that was the only \"step free\" route available for me. But yes I would definitely avoid peak hours if I could. This one wasn't avoidable and no I'm not a tourist. 2. I know I should have thanked him in person and it wouldn't be so hard to do that buttttt I was tugging a sleeping baby in the buggy and I absolutely couldn't think of anything in the moment and just wanted to leave the crowded station as it was so overwhelming. My presence of mind sort of just muted entirely when I reached the station. This was my bad. I do love [SUBREDDIT] which is why I thought maybe posting here would help me reach the person. Who knows maybe not. Just wanted to put my gratitude out there in the universe. All in all I do love this city and it's really a great and friendly place to be. Moments like these remind me more about how great it can be and restores my faith in humanity. *Off with my baby in buggy at peak hour now* (joking haha)",

Yes, the area itself looks lovely nice high street, parks, the river, all that but the noise was absolutely unbearable. I honestly don‚Äôt understand how property prices can be that high in a place where you can't even hear yourself think. Am I missing something? Do locals just get used to it, or are there quieter parts of Richmond somehow shielded from the plane traffic?",

Hey everyone, Just wanted to share a frustrating experience with TfL and maybe get some advice or commiseration. I recently travelled through London in my Euro 6 camper van. I had already confirmed the vehicle meets both ULEZ and LEZ standards, but just to be safe, I registered for Auto Pay. Turns out the LEZ team took their time acknowledging that my vehicle was compliant, and in the meantime, I got hit with three LEZ charges of ¬£300 each, ¬£900 in total. I submitted the necessary proof (Euro 6 clearly stated on the registration docs), they eventually acknowledged everything and credited my Auto Pay account with ¬£900. All good so far. But then‚Ä¶ they charged my credit card anyway. And now, after following up, they‚Äôve told me that my ¬£900 refund is being sent by cheque. Yes, a cheque. In 2025. While I‚Äôm travelling. With a credit card sitting there that could have been refunded directly. Can someone explain why TfL is still operating like it‚Äôs 1987 when it comes to refunds?

    "content": "Targeted with a religious/spiritual scam on Goodge Street So there was, in a very good mood, walking down the road just off of Goodge Street station when a small, middle aged man of what appeared to be Indian decent stopped me. His intro was to tell me that he noticed some wonderful things about me, the first being something about a line on my face telling him a significant success is coming my way in the near future (he tapped my forehead saying from this area he can tell this), but he also pointed out that these lines tell him I am a man that overthinks (he tapped my crows feet üòÇ). He was incredibly friendly and I was in a good mood, so decided to humour him (he was no physical threat and I was in a busy location with no money on me anyway lol). He was incredibly fast talking, with a really unique turn of phrase and a thick accent. Fast forward a lot of spiel and him showing me a photo of his guru (an elderly Hindi looking fella) he wanted to prove to me that what he says his true. He scribbled something really quickly on a tiny torn of piece of paper, screwed it up and gave it to me telling me to put it into my pocket and not look at it. Then he asked a series of questions (favourite colour, choose a number I love, if I had one wish now would it be health or wealth and a couple of other questions). Then he told me to take out the screwed up paper he had given to me. He cupped it in his hand, blew on it and pointed his hand at the sky, he then gave it to me and said I need to do the same. After doing so he asked me to open in and would you have it, it was the answers to all the questions I had given, 100% accurate. As if by magic!......or farrrrr less likely, he did a little slight of hand trick when he cupped it and blew on it. And now for the moment you've been waiting for.....he needs to ask for a donation so he can continue to travel and help others like he had helped me so he will now ask the question am I poor, am I comfortable or am I wealthy and he will ask for a suitable donation based on that. I told him how incredibly poor I am and that I have no cash on me. He kindly offered to come to a cash point with me, which I politely declined and told him I would not be donating today but good luck. He was not at all pleased with me at this point and I walked away to the sound of him muttering something at me. A fun 10 minutes for me, but if this is not your idea of fun, walk away the moment someone approaches you pointing out the meaning behind the wrinkles on your face.",

Hi all, This is a weird one, but for some context: I'm born and raised in North London, but I was a massive introvert in my teen years with maybe one or two friends. I turned 18 in 2021 in that second weird lockdown we had (had my party on zoom lol), did a gap year where all i did was go to work and go home, and I went to uni after that outside of London. Once all my friends from London went to uni, they all decided to stay where they went to uni once they graduated, so I no longer have any friends in London. I'm now 22 and I feel like I missed out on a lot of things in the city I should have been doing since I was way younger. What's a good way to get back into a social life post-uni and meet new people? I'm queer so I do prefer lgbt friendly spaces and I get on better with other queer people.",

All hair types in good condition also welcome, depending on what you want. If you're interested, please let me know what you're after and the Monday you'd like in your FIRST message. Then I'll need to see clear photos of your hair so I can see damage and length. Inspiration photos are also very helpful for colour. Haircuts cost ¬£10. Colour is ¬£20 for tints and ¬£30 for half-head highlights. I'm not doing full head for now. Training appointments take longer than normal. That's why it's cheap! It's up to three hours for the haircut, and the whole afternoon for colour. I can usually be faster, but it depends on your hair and how busy we are. For colour, a skin test is a legal requirement. These can be done on a drop-in basis at the salon, which I'll ask you to do before confirming an appointment. Models get 30% off all Aveda products. Thanks Reddit!",

It's 100% free with no monetisation whatsoever. This is a passion project of mine and currently doesn't cost much for me to run. I built this app to solve a problem many of us may face: Unable to find a decent pint of Guinness or a cheap pint of Guinness in unfamiliar areas. It's a simple map where you can: -Rate your pint on quality and price (in about 30 seconds) -Upload a photo of your pint for others to see -Connect with your friends and other members of the community on the 'community' tab. -Climb the ranks from \"Stout Sprout\" to a \"Guinness Guru\" for every rating you submit. -See how pubs stack up with average ratings in your local area The catch is, the app will only become truly useful when we collect more ratings from our users, and London is really lacking exposure at the moment. So, I'm asking for your help. If you're having a pint at a pub this week, please add your rating. Let's build this into a proper community resource for all of us. Special perk: As a thank you, anyone who signs up in the next 30 days will get an exclusive \"early bird\" badge on their profile forever. You can check the web app out here: [URL] Cheers!",

I‚Äôm trying to expand, and I'm using that word very loosely, my queer social circle. I‚Äôm starting from zero. Looking for recommendations for queer spaces, bars, caf√©s, activities.. anything really. I‚Äôve lived in London for 10 years, so I‚Äôm not new to the city. But I never found my way into the queer community here. I‚Äôve always been shy and introverted, and honestly, new spaces intimidate me. So I stuck to my comfort zone with my small bubble of a few close friends, almost all of whom are straight. Recently, I was talking to another queer person about the idea of home (where you're from vs where you are), and they said they didn‚Äôt feel like their city was home until they found the queer community there. That hit me hard. I‚Äôm a 33-year-old bisexual woman. In the straight circles I unintentionally move in, I often feel like I have to justify or defend my bisexuality. I‚Äôve had straight men look me in the eye and tell me they don‚Äôt ‚Äúbuy it,‚Äù or that I must be doing it for attention. On a recent date, a guy told me it was ‚Äúfine‚Äù that I was bisexual because that would obviously stop being the case if we ended up together. That was a wake-up call. I don‚Äôt want to keep explaining myself to people who just don‚Äôt get it. I want to be around people who do. A big reason I‚Äôve put this off for so long is imposter syndrome around my queerness. I often feel like I don‚Äôt belong in queer spaces. But I‚Äôm starting to realise that my queerness is a real and important part of who I am, and I don‚Äôt want to keep straightifying myself just to make things easier. So.. where do I start?",

I know nationalisation won‚Äôt fix many of the issues which afflict our train network, but this is the fourth day I‚Äôve had which has been affected by signalling issues. I have been at work all day, so I could not get an earlier train. I needed to get a train to Dorset changing through two trains in Surrey. The first was so late that I thought I‚Äôd miss the second meaning I‚Äôd miss the third. I asked the train guard what to do just to see what he would say. His first reaction was, why didn‚Äôt you get an earlier train? Well there was originally 20 mins changeover and now it‚Äôs been reduced to two minutes. Also I‚Äôve been at work so I can‚Äôt get an earlier train. He then said if I missed my advance single I‚Äôd have to refund it on the website and buy a new ticket. So that means buying an extortionate on the day ticket and then refunding my much cheaper advance ticket which I bought a month ago. I wouldn‚Äôt have done that. I would have either gone home or risked it on the third train. I hear now the office for rail are thinking of making people who contest penalty fares potentially liable for criminal offences even for just challenging the fine. I‚Äôve had to technically fare evade so many times even though I‚Äôve had a ticket every single time. But yet I‚Äôd be made to feel like a criminal even if I am not! Finally to make things better, the guard kept on going in and out of the drivers cab talking to the driver which I know is part of his job.

So I‚Äôm aware of disabilities and have a lot more empathy than a usual person has. However, I feel uneasy around homeless people and/or the mentally unwell because I have noticed that they are often under the influence and have lost their inhibition. Many also have nothing to lose and could attack you. I was on a train recently with my mum, a homeless man approached her asking for water, she gave him some, then I told her to stop engaging. He then came over and asked for chocolate and she said we had none. We moved a carriage and he followed us. The whole time he was interacting with my mum he was addressing her as babe and hun. I‚Äôm not from London so never sure what to do. I know it‚Äôs really judgmental to be wary of homeless people, but for the factors listed above I feel somewhat justified. Am I wrong in having this perspective? How would a typical Londoner react to this? I left feeling a little bad as he did only want food, however, when I‚Äôm in London I feel that I have to clam up and put on a cold demeanour because I feel that no one would help me if things were to escalate.",

Me and my husband have both just turned 50, and had asked our accountant (we run a small ltd carpentry company) to recommend a pension advisor, as my pension through Nest is minimal, and my husband had stopped paying into a private one a few years ago when money was tight. We were recommended St James Place and had signed up with them in December 2024. We've since heard pretty negative things about the company and I'm really worried we've made a massive mistake in going with them. Was going with this company a big mistake? Is it easy to change pension provider? I'd approached a couple of smaller independent advisors in our local town before opening this one, but no one ever got back to me, so we'd both really relied on our accountant's recommendation. Any constructive advice would be really appreciated, before we go on much further. Thanks",

When we first moved in we noticed that we would get letters for a small company. For the first period of time we didn't think much about it and put the letters to one side. At the same time we also received letters for an individual - as far as we knew it was unlinked to the above company. We just thought it was the last tenant. Over the years, we've received more and more of these letters for the company and this individual. Even having the odd person knock at the door asking for the individual - I believe it was a baliff but I can't be sure. We asked the landlord about a year ago if they knew either the company or the individual. He said he had absolutely no idea about either. Last month, for the first time, we noticed that there is a small label near our external doorbell which is for the company, the one listed in the letters. Last week, we got a letter about who is registered to vote at our address - this unknown individual is listed. Today, I decided I'd try to figure it all out. I've looked on companies house but can't find what I'm looking for (perhaps I'm confused with her to find out that information). However, I found a website for the company. On the companies website, my address is listed. They list my address for where packages/letters should be sent. I decided to call the company. I decided to not reveal who I was initially in case they decided to not speak to me. A person answered the phone - they revealed themself to have the exact name of the person from our letters. Our unknown mystery individual. I spoke to them for a bit. And eventually asked for an address to send some information - he read out to me my own address. I thanked him and hung up. Now what should I do? What is it that this company/person is likely doing? EDIT: I have searched all over companies house but can't find anything. I've looked for the companies name, I've looked on their website for anything else they might be registered as and nothing either. I've even put my address into companies house but nothing shows up. Is there any way for me to find out what they are registered under?",

    "content": "Have I missed anything in my budget - trying to clear debts I've had about ¬£15k credit card debt for some time, all on 0% cards that I shift around and make minimum payments on so it is coming down, but incredibly slowly. My circumstances are that until last month had a job earning ¬£52,000 as a sole earner for a family with 4 kids - my wife is a SAHM which reduced childcare but the kids are now in full time education so is looking for work. My outgoings are approximately ¬£3300 p/m. With a salary of ¬£52,000 my take home was pretty much equal to the outgoings making savings and clearing debt difficult. This is split at a high level as follows: * Food shopping inclusive of household items like cleaning products, toothpaste, toilet roll etc - ¬£750 - I'm aware this is high and have got this figure by averaging what my wife is spending over 3 months. She's shocked by it too and working to reduce it. Keen to hear what other families with 4 kids are spending on food to get a benchmark * Prescription pre-pay certificate - ¬£22.32 (for both me and my wife who are on regular meds) * Mortgage - ¬£350 * House insurance, energy, water and council tax - ¬£410 * Car running costs incl fuel, breakdown cover, insurance and repairs budget (two cars, one is a 11yr old car owned outright the other is a 3yr old car on HP) - ¬£450 * I'm conscious running an 11yr old car is a risk, but I can at any time opt into a company car via my job and get something for around ¬£200 pm with insurance etc all built into the cost so ought to be in a similar position even if my current car breaks. * Mobile phones, broadband, Spotify, Life insurance - ¬£130 * Credit card minimum payments - ¬£373 * Activities and clubs (kids swimming lessons, gym, other clubs and activities) - ¬£215 (the bulk of this is the swimming lessons at ¬£75) * \"Other\" category contains dentist, a budget for buying clothes, birthday and Christmas presents, holiday savings, cycling insurance, and so on - ¬£675 I've just started a new job however at ¬£83,000 which puts my take home around ¬£4,500. I expect to clear the card debts (prioritising the ones which expire the 0% offer soonest) by Jan 2027. This honestly has been such a help to my mental health to know there is now a way out of debt and it's really not too far off. We've both agreed our lifestyle will not change and the money will be split into various pots to avoid us seeing it as an excuse to treat ourselves etc. However... My wife last week disclosed to me she's accrued ¬£35k of debt herself. She's always had spending problems and had assured me since the last 'slip' she was sorted. Note the last 'slip' was where I gained the ¬£15k of credit card debt as I shifted them to 0% in my name to help her. This has scuppered any plan of me clearing this any time soon but she is now actively looking for a job to bring in some income to clear her debts. She also runs a small 'from home' business which is the cause of the debts as she bought far too much stock (and is paying for a storage space that I never see). Her sales are good, but not enough to clear ¬£35k of stock any time soon. Unfortunately her debt is also in her name, not under the business, so I don't think bankrupting the business would be of any benefit nor do I have any idea what's involved with that. So essentially I'm just looking for confirmation that we're going about this the right way, i.e. clearing those debts down, my wife getting a job, and reducing the food bill which is the single biggest spend.",

I'm 43, live in London and earn ¬£14.5K, which barely covers my essential outgoings, so mostly live deep in my overdaft. My limit is ¬£1750 and I often hit my limit before the end of the month.

If so what would be the best way to do this without paying too much interest? I am financially illiterate and have no idea about this stuff, I've never even had a credit card before as I don't trust myself with one (but managed to rack up debt elsewhere anyway). I don't have much family and they are poor too so a personal loan isn't an option.

    "content": "Confusion about max tax free lump sum from an AVC linked to the NHS pension, versus for example the similar LGPS (x-post: [SUBREDDIT]) Hi, I am looking for anyone with experience in seeking or experiencing the answer to this specific detail regarding NHS MPAVCs. Currently, if one is a member of the NHS pension scheme 2015 (the ‚Äúmain‚Äù defined benefit scheme) and has also arranged an NHS approved linked MPAVC via Prudential or Standard Life (the ‚ÄúAVC‚Äù defined contribution arrangement), and wants to take benefits of both components at the same time, what is the max tax free lump sum from the AVC arrangement? Is it 25% of the AVC pot? - I know it would seem so if reading the default line of the NHSBSA or Pr[USER]. Or is it up to 100% of the AVC pot (if this is still below 25% of the value of all pensions, in this case the main+AVC, and one is still below the LSA) - This seems more in line with the wider law and is also what is explicitly stated on the similar Local Government Pension Scheme website regarding their partner AVC arrangements. I am wondering/hoping that the latter is true and has been neglected from the readily available information on the NHS MPAVC. Or does the NHS scheme really get ‚Äúspecial‚Äù different treatment in this regard compared to LGPS and other pensions? I am thinking I am much more inclined to save via an MPAVC if the latter is true as it would allow one to take more tax free lump sum without having to commutate the main scheme benefits at the rather low 12:1 rate. It is difficult to find an answer without being at retirement age now and NHSBSA advise me to ask Pru, whilst Pru advises me to seek financial advice.",

This is the first time, so going forward, would I be correct in saying that if I'm due to pay ¬£10,000 for 2024-2025 PLUS the payment on account of ¬£5,000 by January, then assuming all the figures are the same, next April 2026 when I file, I should only owe ¬£10,000 right? The 5k left for this year plus the estimated 5k for 2026-27 right? Aside from this first time, I'm not going to be hit with any 50% extras etc? No hold up, it says second payment due 31st July 2026 will be ¬£0.00, if someone could explain that that would be great.... it changed on the next pay for \"¬£5\" by July 2026, which makes more sense. So I pay the outstanding POA ¬£5k (plus any changes) PLUS the NEXT first POA. (figures made up for ease of understanding)",

    "content": "HMRC/Corporation Tax Issue (outside refund timeline) Good morning, I hope this finds everybody well. I've had an ongoing issue with my Corporation Tax for a number of years now and at the root of the problem is basic incompetence from Accountants I was paying for the purpose of doing, well, accounting for my company. Essentially after going through three different firms I have managed to establish that CIS deductions for Corporation Tax totalling c. ¬£16,500 for the tax years 2018-2018 and 2018-2019 were never sent through to HMRC, despite my having emailed assurances that this was done and that I would have 'no corporation tax to pay'. My outstanding bill is c. ¬£18K of which I certainly owe a chunk which I am happy to pay as it is owing to HMRC, I haven't paid either of the last two years' bills because of the certainty that they woudl take the money and use it to plug the gaps from earlier years caused by this non-application for deductions for the two tax years stated above. I have email correspondence and proof of the figures, but I am aware that it is now outside the HMRC timeframe for a refund. I can provide evidence that all I essentialy owe them is for the last two years and if I could settle at that I would do it like a shot to get it over with. What, if any, options do I have, I would love to get a face to face with HMRC to go through the numbers to back my case up but it would be easier to get an audience with the Pope, and my accountant is a wet lettuce, his only redeeming feature is that he isn't as bad as the last two. If anyone has any advice on what steps I can take or who I should speak to in order to get this matter resolved, or even has some facts, painful or otherwise, for me, I would be super grateful :) TIA",

Are there any other considerations that impact your investments? This might be a really stupid question, but it started niggling at me this morning and I don't feel confident that I'd get a straight forward answer from Google.

Hi, I read the pension regulator's guidelines and it says: [[URL] >However, by law, when you take contributions from your staff's pay you must pay these to your pension scheme by the 22nd (19th if you pay by cheque) day of the next month. And in the trustee guide: [[URL] >mustn‚Äôt show any due date for member contributions later than the 22nd day of the month following deduction from pay (or the 19th day if payments aren‚Äôt made electronically) My employer have said that they pay the pension provider on the 22nd. And that the pension provider gets a bulk payment for all employees and then they take \"on average\" 5 days to \"allocate\" the payments. And that the payment may not arrive in the pension until the first week of the following month. So, I get my June pay at the end of June with salary sacrifice pension deducted, the employer holds it for 22 days and then the pension provider holds it for up to \\~15 days. Then I get it in my pension. So, does \"pay to your pension scheme\" mean \"pay to the company running the pension\" or \"pay into the employees pension pot\"? If it's the first, it makes the rule a bit irrelevant really. They can pay the provider by the 22nd and the provider has all the time in the world to generate their own interest off my pension before they give it to me. \"Sorry, we decided not to put that money in your pot for 25 years because it was making us money\" - and there is no rule to say that isn't allowed... Is there?? (If you are a pension provider reading this, please do not do that!) (Based in England with salary sacrifice pension with a UK registered employer and pension provider)",

My plan is ¬£100k in Hargreaves Lansdown - S&S - VWRP (set and forget). Currently got a Trading212 S&S ISA with 20k. Will add 20k to this - in VUAG. Leaves roughly 180k. My (somewhat paranoid) thought is to put into NS&I because it's so safe. I like the whole 'only withdrawals to nominated accounts' situation and their security is good. I do use mobile banking but don't feel very secure with it, and I don't like the idea of having 85k each in two separate savings accounts that could potentially be hacked or scammed some how - if somebody got hold of my phone. I spend a lot of time in Asia and if I lost my phone I would struggle to contact banks quickly should that happen. However NS&I is not a v good savings rate compared to other accounts. Can anyone suggest an alternative or a bank that has very good security - perhaps not even using mobile banking - that would allow me to get better returns on the cash savings? If anyone knows a savings account that has similar security to NS&I that would be right up my alley. Thanks in advance !",

    "content": "Employer being strange about pay (random first instalment of pay without payslip before being \"properly added to payroll\") Hi all, hope you're well! I am in a strange situation with my (short-term, hospitality summer job) employer and wonder if I can get any advice here. This is my third week of working a hospitality summer job which has been very odd regarding my pay. The job was meant to pay a weekly wage, but there have been repeated delays filling in my paperwork. I have \\*still\\* not filled out a written contract, though I have given bank details and NI number. All of this is frustrating but has not been a problem for me as I'm living with family and do not need the pay instantly. Yesterday I was sent some money. I asked if I could have a payslip for it, and one of the two managers told me that I am not properly on payroll yet and that they were paying me anyway so I wouldn't have to do without. (Note that I did not ask them to do this, though I have been hounding them about sorting out my contract.) I said that I needed to be sure that proper contributions (NI etc.) had been paid and wanted to know precisely what dates this pay was supposed to represent (it didn't seem to line up with my first week, nor the second week, nor a combination of the two, in gross pay). In response to this, the manager suggested I could send them the money back and wait until I am properly on payroll before I receive anything. This is currently what I am leaning towards: I am very anxious to do everything by the book and have my pay be properly \"on the books\", so to speak. Would anyone here have advice on what best to do? For the medium term, I am thinking that I might leave this job as all of this reflects badly on management in my opinion. Centrally, though, I want advice on how to make sure that my pay for the work done so far (and in the immediate future, whether or not I do give notice and leave) is properly documented and that the proper contributions are made. Thank you all!",

With this in mind and what I‚Äôve read on here about investment horizons, keeping an entire house deposit invested is risky. Note I am probably only going to use a proportion of this amount for a house as I still want to invest long term in VWRP. Currently I am holding the following in my S&S ISA: Cash (21%) VWRP (47%) Lifestrategy 100% equity (31%) the first move I am considering is moving out of lifestrategy and into cash and moving all of this cash into a MMF note I am only invested in lifestrategy 100 fund to limit my US exposure (60%) in VWRP. Questions: Given the timeline what is a sensible move. Open to discussing anything as there may be things I haven‚Äôt thought of.",

Back in December last year I was lucky enough to be able to sell some of my work share options which were then paid through PAYE, which was great reward after years of working hard.

    "content": "Family crumbling -- Mum took out ¬£26k loan for her brother; he can't pay it back in time. What can be done? My mum (late 50s) took out a ¬£26k loan to bring her brother (30s) to the UK to study Nursing in 2022, which he's just finished. We're from a developing country, but my mum has been a UK citizen for decades, and I've always lived here. This loan is creating massive tension, as whoever my mum got it from is (apparently) hounding her about repayments. I don't know every detail of the situation, and I'm avoiding seeking more cus I'm stressed enough and asking my mum about money typically doesn't go well. My brain is so scattered, I can't even think of what information would be important to share here (sorry if I miss anything). Right now, I know my uncle has been repaying my mum since he got here, but it's never been \"enough\" as he could only work 2 days a week as a student. Now, my mum wants my uncle to sign an agreement she recently wrote. He's starting as a full-time nurse soon, and he expects to earn ¬£2-2.4k/month post-tax but before travel or rent, depending on how many extra shifts he can get. My mum wants ¬£1882/monthly. My uncle asked if she can request an extension from the loaner as can't give ¬£1882 monthly. He told her he intends to qualify for another bank loan next year that he would use to clear her debt; he also has a 10k personal loan to deal with. Mum told him her loaner won't extend it, but also said my uncle should get another loan from the bank now to make a lump repayment to her loaner so she can ask for an extension after that. They've been going in circles for a while. I believe they need an objective third party to review all the loans, my uncle's finances, and create a realistic plan they can tackle TOGETHER. I also feel my mum needs to be open to possibly needing to contribute to the loan too, since it's HER credit that could get messed up, but she wouldn't listen if I say that. I've told my uncle to contact the Citizens Advice Bureau and his bank about the situation, but he doesn't understand how they work, and I'm not 100% about the level of help they'd provide. I'm wondering if there are other agencies that can help or other angles this can be approached from. I need this situation to end. Being caught in the middle makes me uncomfortable. Seeing both of them miserable makes me unhappy. But, mostly, the whole thing triggers me. My uncle has shared things my mum has said to him, and the extreme behaviour she's displayed over this loan, and I'm taken back to times she's treated me the same cus I haven't done what she wants or been able to do it, especially regarding money. He doesn't know what I experienced growing up, yet he describes feeling the same anxiety, stress, fear and dread I always have. Seeing someone else experience my mum like this is a feeling I can't describe; the closest word is 'painful'. *************************** EDIT: My mum has sent my uncle a new agreement and he showed it to me. She's now asking for: - ¬£5k lump sum to be paid December 2025 (something they'd already agreed) - ¬£1255.55/monthly from Jan 1st 2026 to June 1st 2027 BUT she's added PENALTIES: ¬£100 late fee, full repayment if two payments missed, legal action to recover any outstanding amount -INTEREST: 10% He asked why she added penalties but she wouldn't say. I suspect this is a redraft of her agreement with her loaner cus it's got proper legal jargon. He doesn't want to sign it.",

    "content": "Take out higher loan at better APR, then immediately pay some of it back? Hi all, Bit of help required on this idea I have for a car loan. I want to check my maths is correct and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with what I‚Äôm planning. The total of the car is ¬£17k, so I was going to pay a ¬£4k deposit myself and then loan ¬£13k. I wanted to pay this over 4 years. My credit union offer loans at 10.4% APR for loans between ¬£7,500-¬£14,999. This means my ¬£13k loan would have 48 repayments of ¬£329 at a total of ¬£15,814. However, they offer 8.84% APR for loans over ¬£15k. If I take out a ¬£15k loan, doing it over 55 months (4 years 7 months), my repayments are virtually the same - ¬£330. If I was to: * Reduce my deposit payment to ¬£2k on the car and use the ¬£15k credit loan for the carz * Then, use my spare ¬£2k I‚Äôve saved from the deposit to and immediately (or wait a few weeks if it‚Äôs dodgy to do it immediately) put it towards early repayment of the loan. This would turn my loan into a ¬£13k loan * I calculate this as being approx 47 months off repayments, and working out at a lot less interest than the 10.4% APR loan of ¬£13k? I‚Äôve already checked and my credit union have no penalties or issues with early repayment, it‚Äôs actually one of their biggest selling points they push as a reason to loan with them. I self confess I‚Äôm not too clued up on finance or loans so please feel free to tell me either why this is wrong, or not allowed, or a bad idea. But if explaining, please try to dumb it down to a newbie! Many thanks in advance",

Ok, this is not a BTL doom and gloom bashing, it‚Äôs more of a personal situation that goes against all of my beliefs and I‚Äôm struggling to make the right decision. We are in a good position and have taken calculated risks over the years to where we now have our own home with 65% or more equity, and 3 buy to let‚Äôs. However in terms of cash reserves, we don‚Äôt keep much more than a month or two as accessible cash. I‚Äôve always been comfortable feeling uncomfortable. But recently I‚Äôm seeing things a different way, with kids now in our life, maybe less stress is a worthwhile trade off. So we recently had a long term tenant move out of a rental so have taken the opportunity to modernise it and get it back to standard. Our plan was always to re-let but had an estate agent round last week. The figures for selling are seriously tempting. We have about ¬£20k on a personal loan for one car and this is the only non- mortgage debt we have. We‚Äôre now discussing, should we go against what we have always done and cash in on this property while it is good as new, pay off our loan and save some interest. Then put a healthy 6-8 month emergency fund away. We should be able to get out about ¬£60k profit. ¬£20k loan saving ¬£20k emergency fund ¬£20k in our cash accounts to allow us save more regularly and enjoy life a little more. I‚Äôm really struggling with selling one of my investments that I‚Äôve nurtured so much, but my head also says that we‚Äôre now in a different world and the maths adds up. Less stress, ¬£500 loan payment saved and a good chunk of interest payments stopped. Also savings accounts offset the ever decreasing profits from BTL currently. Couple all that with the fact the property is in a really good standard and the market is healthy, does it so clearly make sense to sell and enjoy a more stress free life for a little.

    "content": "Moving to Universal Credit but have LISA Savings Hi, I'm hoping someone can help me make a decision. Advice welcome and appreciated. My wife and I foster and then adopted a child with severe learning difficulties. He is now a 27yr old man and remains in need of a lot of care. We have power of attorney to oversee his finances and have been really careful to ensure we plan for his future. We are especially concerned about the end part of his life when we will no longer be alive to care for him. We want to prepare as much as possible and so opened a LISA account to save for his retirement. This currently stands at ¬£15k He was receiving PIP and ESA benefits. We have been told he will now be moving to Universal Credit. He will never be able to work and so his care costs are met solely by benefits. I understand that if he has savings over ¬£16k he won't get anything. His current savings will reduce his UC amount. However, if we cash in his LISA at this point he will be penalised. This seems incredibly unfair when we are trying to make him financially independent for the future so he doesn't rely on the state. Also, for clarity, the only reason he can save anything from his current benefit income is because we fund so much that he would otherwise not be able to afford. When we stop working in the next few years this will no longer be possible. He also isn't eligible for housing benefit because he still lives in our house (we've turned half our downstairs into a little self-contained place for him). Any thoughts on how we can best support him now and in the future? TIA",

    "content": "Buying a property for my parent‚Äôs to live in Hi, I am considering buying a bungalow and living in it myself for the short to medium term future. When my parents retire in ~10 years I‚Äôd like them to sell their house and move into the bungalow (to make their lives easier getting around the place etc and so they can enjoy the equity in their current home). I would move out of the bungalow and likely buy another place to live in. I would still have a mortgage on the bungalow at that point (let‚Äôs say ¬£100k to make it simple). Rather than paying me any rent, I was thinking they could use some of the proceeds from their house sale (they are mortgage free and again to keep it simple let‚Äôs say their house will be worth ¬£500k in 10 years time) to gift me the ¬£100k to clear my mortgage balance. They could then live in the bungalow for as long as needed (hopefully a long time!) and enjoy their retirement with the remainder of the proceeds from their house. The plan would be that they pay all bills at the bungalow (utilities and council tax etc). My questions are: 1. Would there be any tax implications for myself or my parents? If I was collecting a traditional monthly rent from them I assume there would be a tax liability for me, but I‚Äôm unclear how it works if they are gifting me the money to clear the mortgage balance and I then don‚Äôt charge them any rent. 2. Would I be liable for any CGT further down the line? 3. If my parents end up in care at any point, would the ‚Äòstate‚Äô have any claim on the bungalow?

I can't do without that extra 4k income, because my work salary only covers my core outgoings.

If I get made redundant I can see it being very difficult to find a new job over 50, and I need my money accessible for emergencies. I want to split up the 110k between different types of savings/investments - a smallish amount in higher risk equities that I hope grow, some in a money market fund for stability and easy access cash, but perhaps a dividend fund would be best for the bulk of it, if that can guarantee a minimum fixed income? I already have investments in vwrp, FTSE global all cap, and money market funds so I kind of know about them. I need something less equity-heavy than index funds, but more growth oriented than money market. Thanks!",

I'm not really hopeful that there is a solution to my issue but I'm here to find out if anyone has any ideas! Basically trying to find information on this online is difficult, and I actually already managed to find a 'wrong' answer about stamp duty so I'm wary of googling for advice. My dad is currently in a shared equity situation with a housing association in which he owns around 60k (50%) of a property. We (my wife and I) are now in a position to help him and ideally he'd like to move somewhere nearer to us and we'd like to assist him with living somewhere a bit nicer. We have found a property that costs around 220k which is perfect for him and he loves. My wife and I will contribute everything above the amount he is comfortable with (and able to) invest which is 65k, so we will be investing 155k. Initially the plan was to gift him the 155k allowing him to purchase the property himself and he would then bequeath the 155k back to us in his will. (Well the % but let's not complicate things) My sister and I are the sole beneficiaries and he has no other assets so will be well below the IHT threshold. However, he then started thinking about the impact of possible care requirements and that essentially he would be putting our money at risk if we do it this way around as he could lose the house to pay for care. Therefore we are now thinking about jointly purchasing the property. Unfortunately, my wife and I already have a residential property that we live in so we make dads new flat liable to the additional stamp duty rate...you'd think the tax would apply to each parties percentage investment separately but alas it doesn't work like that...so essentially by becoming joint owners with dad we are going to be hit with a 12k stamp duty bill. We then will also be hit with capital gains on our share when we eventually sell....so on a contribution of 150k we 'begin' by basically losing 10%. Is there any method I am missing by which we can assist dad to purchase the property. Obviously 12k is a significant amount of money and dad is extremely hesitant to 'allow' us to take such a hefty hit on his behalf just so he can move...but at the same time hes absolutely not willing to take the risk that he could 'lose' our money were he to need care at some point in the future. Any other solution out there",

    "content": "Parents want to gife me a rental property. Is it better now for CGT or in a discretionary trust? Hello, I was trying to get a definitive answer on the costs involved in terms of CGT or IHT on a rental property my parents would like to transfer over to me, to potentially avoid IHT in the future. I'll give as much info as I can. I hate talking about these things, but my father is 80 this year, so as morbid as it is, he's trying to find the best, and most cost-effective way of doing it. My parents own a rental property (not their main residence), which they would like to gift to me. They originally bought the property for ¬£146,000 a few years ago and think the value should be between ¬£190,000 and ¬£210,000 now. Do you know how the CGT would work if they signed it over to me? They are both retired and receive their pensions plus the ¬£750 rent per month from this property. Is it correct that there would be no SDLT either, as there is no mortgage and no money is exchanging hands? They spoke to someone who specialises in setting up trusts, and they mentioned CGT would be ¬£27,000, but this seems very high to me based on the purchase value and the current market value. This has kind of put my father off signing over now, as, understandably, he doesn't want to fork out that much. So he was thinking of going down the discretionary trust route, but this looks like it is just delaying/deferring the CGT further down the line, if I were to sell the property in the future. I did some research myself, and it was coming out a lot less based on them being low-rate taxpayers (is this right?), more like ¬£8,000 to ¬£10,000. Which, between my parents and me, would be something we would be willing to cover. I do think the Trust person added in the 1/3 (I have a brother and sister who have already been given a property each), I would get from their main residence (approx ¬£400k) into it, though. She has been trying to push the trust on my father, talking about Holdfast relief, etc., but I don't think this is actually a whole lot different? Also, would it be better to add my mother to the property's mortgage so they get an extra ¬£3,000 CGT allowance for the transfer to me? At the moment, only my dad is on the property, so the extra allowance could help bring the costs down. My father is 79 and my mother is 69, so would adding my mother to the property also apply the 7-year IHT rule to my mother once it is signed over (another morbid question, I know)? I have been trying to figure out all the costs of a) signing the house over, b) adding my mother to the mortgage, and c) creating a declaration of trust to say my parents will still be taking all the rent money. Bit of an info dump, sorry, but wanted to give as much detail as possible. If there is anything else I should have mentioned then please let me know. I'm hoping someone can help. Thanks",

    "content": "Advice on transitioning from cash to stocks and shares ISA My wife and I are aiming to pay off our ¬£385,000 mortgage within the next 6 years. We‚Äôre just starting on a new two year fixed rate deal over 25 years, which is a mix of a 2.75% ported mortgage and a new portion at 4.19%, giving us an effective interest rate of about 3.15%. Our monthly repayment is ¬£1,845, and we‚Äôre able to overpay or save an additional ¬£2,000 per month. We‚Äôve calculated that if we can earn a 5% annual return on our savings, we could build enough to clear the mortgage by year 6 assuming we can maintain both our monthly payments and savings, even if interest rates rise after our fixed period ends. At the moment, we have around ¬£120,000 in cash ISAs. We plan to keep 20% of our total savings in a flexible cash ISA as a buffer, and move the rest into stocks & shares ISAs to try and achieve a better return. The plan is to invest primarily in a global equity tracker (like FTSE All World) and a global bond ETF. My main concern is how to time and structure the move from cash to investments. I‚Äôm nervous about putting the full lump sum into the market at once, especially when markets feel high but also keen to try and improve the return quickly. I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice or insight on how best to approach this, and whether there are smarter strategies.",

    "content": "Very complex issue regarding money, debt, name changes and civil court case. Hi ‚Äî I‚Äôm looking for legal, financial, and practical advice. This is deeply personal, so please be kind. I'm a UK survivor of extreme childhood abuse. While in the care system, I was subjected to multiple sexual assaults, rapes, physical torture and psychological torture, and was nearly murdered twice. I‚Äôm currently suing the local authority and private care providers involved in my case. It‚Äôs a civil case, not criminal ‚Äî and I have legal support. The people involved in my abuse knew me by my birth name. Years ago, I changed my name legally, and I now have a British passport in that name ‚Äî so identity documents are not an issue. However, during my legal case, my current name was used in court paperwork and correspondence that the defendants got. So after the case is finished, I‚Äôm planning to change my name again, permanently, to keep myself protected. That original name is a huge trigger for me. I never want to hear it again, and I want no one ‚Äî not banks, companies, or authorities ‚Äî to ever link me to it again. When I was younger and struggling, I ended up with some unpaid debts ‚Äî under both my birth name and current name. They‚Äôre not huge debts (mostly phone contracts, catalogues, etc.) Once I receive compensation, I‚Äôm willing to pay them off just to avoid being traced or hunted down ‚Äî even though I‚Äôm not in contact with those companies anymore. But here‚Äôs what terrifies me: What if one of those debts ends up as a CCJ? Could a company try to get an Attachment of Earnings order? Could a judge or creditor trace me through HMRC if they get an attachment of earnings orders, if I‚Äôve changed my name and moved? Im also unemployed. Could any of this link my new identity to the old one, and possibly expose me to people connected to my abusers? I want to fully disappear from that past ‚Äî not because I‚Äôm trying to commit fraud, but because I‚Äôm trying to stay safe and protect my mental health. I do not have a bank account right now. Once my case is over and I change my name again, I plan to open a fresh account under my new legal name, with new contact info and address. But I‚Äôm scared that: If I open a new account and don‚Äôt declare old names, they might later accuse me of hiding something If I do declare past names, it could link me to debt or risk me being found I‚Äôm exhausted. I‚Äôve done nothing wrong. I‚Äôm just trying to live a safe life. I‚Äôll likely receive a compensation payout once the legal case ends. But here‚Äôs the issue. If I‚Äôve changed my name by then (which I need to for safety), the money will technically be awarded under my \"old\" name, and I‚Äôll have a bank account in my new name. I‚Äôm scared the bank will: Ask for proof of where the money came from See that the legal award was in a different name Accuse me of identity fraud Flag me with a CIFAS marker, freeze my money, or close the account, and link me with my old names. At the same time, I cannot emotionally or safely disclose my old name. It‚Äôs a major PTSD trigger. I want no digital or paper trail that could ever link me to it again. I was also thinking about a move to Ireland for a fresh start, under the Common Travel Area agreement. That part is legally straightforward ‚Äî I don‚Äôt need a visa as a UK citizen. But to live or work there, I‚Äôll need an Irish PPS number (their version of a National Insurance number). To get that, I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll be asked for: My birth certificate Proof of past names or UK identity Documents that could force me to disclose my old name That‚Äôs something I really want to avoid ‚Äî for both safety and trauma reasons. I don‚Äôt want my past to follow me into a new country or show up in government records. I have a few questions; 1. Can debt collectors or CCJ courts access HMRC or trace your employment under a new name? 2. If I open a bank account or apply for credit in a new name and don‚Äôt declare previous names, could I be accused of fraud or get a CIFAS marker? 3. How can I safely receive compensation under a new name without being flagged or forced to explain name changes? 4. What exactly is a trust? Can my solicitor hold or distribute the money through one, so it‚Äôs not directly linked to my name? 5. When applying for an Irish PPS number, can I avoid giving my birth name or documents that link me to it? I‚Äôve already survived the worst. All I want is to live safely, quietly, and without being constantly retraumatised by the system. If you have any experience in law, finance, trauma support, or Irish residency, please help. Even advice or links would mean a lot. Thank you for reading this.",

    "content": "Joint mortgage with parent who has been missing payments First time I've wrote something long form about this so please let me know if I miss anything. &nbsp; Starting from the beginning, Back in early 2024, due to personal circumstances with harassment from my Dad (They were separated Mid divorce) and my Mums business as a dog walker I convinced myself to get a mortgage with my mum to help out (Silly financially, already kind of knew this but let emotions get in the way). The general plan for this was for me to be mostly hands off and I'd pay \"rent\" same as usual whilst she used this money to pay the bills from her current account. After a few months, my Dad passed away in a car accident. As my mum was not officially divorced, the responsibility for this fell on my Mum (Sorting funeral etc.). Due to this, she had lost a large sum of money that would otherwise have been made via her business as she was essentially shut for a month+ dealing with the fallout. During this time she also started to run into chronic illness issues in the form of COPD making further work difficult. She started getting things business wise on track again after a couple of months and I had thought that all was relatively well until during December I started getting calls from the mortgage company regarding missing payments. I spoke to mum about this who had talked about the above and I started increasing payments towards the mortgage to help out. During this time I 110% should have taken this more seriously than I did and been more hands on but I guess a mixture of immaturity and trust led me to just assume that was that. Fast forward to this past month, the mortgage lender has filed for a court hearing to work out the ability to get repossession order as the arrears have spiralled to ¬£9,354.69 fees included. I've over this past month managed to finally get more information out of my mum on the whole situation (Seems she got a chunk of inheritance from Dad and spent it gambling). I have received some bank statements from her and have told her that I would be creating an account that she will be paying into in order to get some level of control over her finances as well as requesting her statements each month. I've spoken to the mortgage lender and have given all of this information as well as an income and expenditure form as well as 3 months of slips from all of our accounts in hopes we can work something out before the court date. &nbsp; I guess the question I have here sis if there is anything I can do to get more on top of all of this. I've been stupidly hands off with this and let things get to this point. Also if anyone has any experience with gambling of any sorts, is there a way I can get the companies to block payments from her accounts? My mum is in the process of talking to Citizens Advice about any loans that are left as well as getting access to benefits due to the affect the COPD is having on her health. Not sure if there is anything else she could/should be seeking regarding this so any info on that would be great too. &nbsp; Thanks.",

    "content": "How to value defined benefit and defined contribution pensions? I'm in my early 30s and work in the public sector. I'm on a defined benefit CARE pension, meaning that my future annual pension increases by about 2% (ish) of what I earn each year, inflation adjusted. I've paid into this from day one, as I've not been kicked in the head by a horse. I don't have any other pension pots, and if I stay here another two decades or so (and pay off my mortgage) then I'll be okay in retirement from this pension plan alone. Perhaps better than okay. I'm not sure if I want to stay here for another 20+ years, however. But when looking at other jobs in the private sector, which almost exclusively have defined contribution pensions, I'm struggling to value my total pay packet, when factoring in pensions. E.g. another job which offers me the same salary, and practically the same employee contributions of ~5%, but only offers me the baseline auto-enrollment 3% employer's contributions, that would be a pretty significant pay cut - I just don't know how much of a pay cut. I know that I'm trying to compare apples and oranges here. I know that with every year that passes, I'd need a larger DC contribution to result in the same DB entitlement, due to the reduced time for pension savings to grow. And I know there is a long list of variables that would need to be known to come up with an accurate answer. But I currently haven't got the faintest idea, and I feel like I'm searching blindly. So as a rough, bag of fag packet estimate, what price tag do I put on my current DB pension, when comparing it to DC alternatives? How much more would I need to earn before my overall compensation is larger?",

My main anxieties right are paternity Leave: My wife and I are thinking about starting a family in the next year or two. The thought of zero income for what would have been paid paternity leave is terrifying. Is there anything at all for self-employed individuals in the UK for this? Or is it purely a case of saving every penny and taking unpaid time off? Sick pay - If I get ill and can't work (which, let's face it, is always a risk in a physical job), that's it. Zero income. Are there specific insurance products (income protection?) that are genuinely worth it for self-employed people in the trades? How do you budget for potential weeks off with no pay. Similarly , saving up for holidays I know this is less significant than the above, but the idea of every holiday meaning zero income is a bit of a mental shift.

I know that there are potentially a lot of details that would need to be looked at, but unless I‚Äôm mistaken there‚Äôs a specific point that makes it not worth investigating further!

I am a higher-rate taxpayer. I married my partner in 2022. She has never owned the rental property, nor lived in it. She currently does not have an income, and is not in receipt of any benefits. I was looking into the potential of transferring the rental property to my wife as a joint owner, and thereby using my wife‚Äôs CGT and personal allowances to reduce the total amount of CGT. Having looked at the figures involved, however, I believe that the reduction in CGT I would get via Private Residence Relief (5 years plus the final 9 months) vastly outweighs any potential reduction I could get from my wife‚Äôs allowances. If this is indeed the case, there is no value in me engaging a professional - so really hoping someone can confirm that my assumption is correct, and there isn‚Äôt some strange technicality whereby the PRR can still be applied for my wife despite her never living in the property, or something similar.",

(The technical part) I have ¬£5,863 left of the debt, and the minimum monthly payment that comes out my account is ¬£202. after all of my expenses including the minimum payment, i have around ¬£850 left for the month. Do I put an extra ¬£500 a month towards the debt, and have the debt paid off before 2026 January. I will sell my car either way for around ¬£2,000 to ¬£2,500 but for pessimistic reasons let's say ¬£1,800 which is how much would be left after putting the extra 500 a month towards it for 6 months. OR should I just let the debt be and put the ¬£500 towards savings/ put half savings and half debt? Part of me feels like it's smarter to just attack the debt and accept the fact I have to just live below my means for the rest of the year, but another part of me thinks maybe I should be putting it towards savings or half towards savings and half to the debt. Interested to hear opinions and again, thank you anyone who actually took the time to read. I have learnt my lesson about debt. EDIT: I should mention it was a personal loan from the bank, so the interest rate has already been added and I wouldn‚Äôt pay more if i just stuck with the minimum (at least I believe that‚Äôs how it works)",

    "content": "Do we save, or do we buy a second property? Hi everyone ‚Äì first time posting here, so be kind! I‚Äôm a married homeowner (M39, F37) with a four-year-old son and a ten-month-old daughter. Since my wife returned to work after our son was born, we‚Äôve been putting away ¬£200 a month for him and plan to do the same for our daughter as of September. On top of that, we typically save around ¬£300-500 a month ourselves, though that does fluctuate depending on life stuff. We‚Äôre now starting to think longer-term and would really appreciate a bit of advice. By the time my wife finishes maternity leave next month, we‚Äôll still have around ¬£30k saved. I think we should use it as a deposit on a second property. There‚Äôs a two-bed round the corner listed at ¬£180k that I think could be a solid investment. It‚Äôs close enough for us to manage ourselves and would rent easily - I‚Äôm fairly confident the rental income would cover the mortgage, and for that ¬£30k outlay (deposit + stamp duty), we‚Äôd be giving our kids a physical asset that could grow in value over time. We‚Äôre in a reasonably strong financial position, our income gives us a bit of flexibility. If the numbers stacked up, we could afford to top up the mortgage by a couple of hundred a month if needed. So if it‚Äôs a good long-term play, we‚Äôre open to stretching slightly. That said, my wife‚Äôs more cautious (fairly!), and her main concern is that we‚Äôd like to move to a bigger home ourselves in the next five years. She‚Äôs worried this could impact our mortgage affordability when that time comes, and I don‚Äôt fully know how much of a problem that would be. Another option we‚Äôre weighing up is to leave the ¬£30k where it is and just keep saving into a decent account or maybe even look at investing it - something like a diversified stocks and shares ISA or index tracker - and let it grow that way instead. So I guess the question is: do we buy now and play the long game with more bricks and mortar, or keep building cash/investments and reassess down the line? Has anyone been in a similar position and made either move? Would love to hear your thoughts.",

    "content": "Is paying off a default actually worth it? Long story short, I had a rough patch in 2024. As a result, I ended up with 4 defaults across 4 accounts, totalling around ¬£8k. All registered around this time last year. Fast forward to now, I‚Äôm in a significantly better place financially and things are stable. I could easily pay off the remaining balance in full today without any strain. So my question is: is it actually worth it to clear these debts now? I‚Äôve already come to terms with the fact that meaningful credit is probably off the table for me in the UK for the next few years. That‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm not looking for loans or credit cards any time soon. I already have a mortgage (which has a perfect payment history), and I just renewed my interest rate deal, which is locked in for the next few years. The only scenario where I might need to care about my credit again is if I want to release some equity from my home in 2‚Äì3 years (thinking about a wedding but early stages yet). But I‚Äôm not sure how much these defaults would impact that, whether paid or not. I know the defaults will drop off my credit file after 6 years regardless, so I‚Äôm 1 year in with 5 to go. I also know if I don‚Äôt acknowledge the debts or engage with the creditors, they‚Äôll eventually become statute barred. I know in theory they could take me to court and demand the full amount but realistically the prospects of this actually happening are slim and cost as much as they‚Äôd recover so I‚Äôm not really worried about that. So is there any tangible benefit to paying them now? Do lenders care whether a defaulted debt has been settled or not, or is a default just a default? I know there‚Äôs the moral and psychological aspect of paying it off, but I don‚Äôt particularly care about these and I‚Äôm more interested in practical advice. Would appreciate any insight from those who‚Äôve been through something similar or understand the UK credit system better than I do.",

    "content": "Grandma's house sold to pay for care home fees, what options can my mum do to reduce tax So my grandma is now residing in a care home (well has been for a while). Her house has sold (completed) for about ¬£450,000. We are now, admittedly unfortunately, planning for a time where the remainder of this money will be liable for IHT. The inheritance will be effectively dropping down to my mother and uncle, her direct children. I know that ¬£325,000 will be exempt anyway, and depending how long she lives (her health is not great as you may expect) there could be significant costs with tax, as far as I am aware her cash savings have already been emptied due to the care home costs and while she has a pension, I am unsure if there‚Äôs any sort of lump sum value to it. So for now, we will assume we‚Äôre starting at ¬£450,000. So, the big question I have. I know there‚Äôs a residence nil-rate band linked to houses, effectively increasing the tax threshold to ¬£500,000. My issue is that obviously this money is all cash now as the house was sold in order to pay for care home fees. So, my question is can an argument be made that the majority of this cash is related to property and therefore make use of the residence nil-rate band? If not, can we do anything using a trust for my son (her great granchild) and my niece (her great granchild). This is something my mum has suggested. Say, the remainder over the IHT threshold was split 50/50 between them?",

(Mod approved, cheers <3 !) &nbsp; ___________ &nbsp; #First off - **You don‚Äôt need to justify it or explain why you or your gran or whoever ‚Äòdeserves‚Äô one, because you do and that‚Äôs that**. Just drop me a line and I‚Äôll get one out to you. I've got tons of 'em made up ready to go, so you won't be depriving anyone of one. I cover postage as well, so there‚Äôs no cost at all. &nbsp; [**Here's an example of some boxes!**]([URL] Each box contains: * 4 (or more) random packets of beads and whatnot * A packet with some random charms (could be bloody anything this year, previously it's been just snowflakes but there's lots of variety this year!) * A reel of elastic * Instructions * A little handmade angel dangle charm. &nbsp; While it‚Äôs not much, it‚Äôs something that can take your mind off whatever‚Äôs going on at the mo - when I first started doing these, it was because of lockdown and struggles there. Now we have other crises and struggles, so we're all still under the cosh a bit. It can be for you, or for someone you know. Again, **you don't need to explain why you deserve one** - just drop me a message. I have plenty ready to go (nearly 600 currently); I‚Äôve spent the last year building up to this and have been putting the boxes together since January, so you‚Äôre not going to deprive anyone by having one yourself. There‚Äôs one waiting for you =) &nbsp; ___________ &nbsp; I'll try to get them all out ASAP. **Unfortunately, at this time, I can only post to the UK**. I hope to be able to send abroad next year, but currently the postal cost prohibits this. I can also unfortunately only post one per household at this current time - many apologies for any inconvenience. If you're part of a community organisation or initiative that could use them (victim support, food bank, community craft caf√©, charity, or similar project), please let me know as I have some small sets of 6-18 boxes set aside for such projects. &nbsp; I've been doing these for about five years or something now, and there are certain times people might need to know they're available. Thank you to the mods for allowing me to make this post. You all continue to be glorious specimens <3 &nbsp; ___________ &nbsp; #Q: What's the point of getting beads in a box - how is that meant to help? I do get asked this a fair bit, and it's a valid question. What's a box of beads going to do for mental health? **Distraction, mainly.** It‚Äôs easy to do, but also something with an end result. There‚Äôs enough beads and suchlike in them to make a bunch of necklaces, bracelets or whatever, and it‚Äôs something you can be proud of making for yourself, as gifts or...well, for anyone. Or just break them down and make more. There‚Äôs plenty of elastic. Or, y'know, use the elastic to fire beads at people out of the window. It‚Äôs something very simple that doesn‚Äôt require any previous knowledge or skill, but it‚Äôs time consuming, relaxing, easy to do and has a visible end result you can be proud of. &nbsp; ___________ &nbsp; #Q: Why are you giving these away? What's in it for you? Another very common and very valid question. About 6 years ago, I reached out to CasualUK (with help from mods) and asked for help. I was about to end up back on the street again due to not being able to cover rent, but I had a pile of handmade bracelets, earrings and whatnot that were sat in my little online shop unsold. There were thousands of them, and they'd been there for months/years because I'm absolutely pants at marketing. With help from the mods and other kind people, some of these sold and I was able to claw myself back from the brink a bit and get back on my feet a little. These things need paying forward. I don't have much, but I have beads. A shitload of beads. &nbsp; ___________ &nbsp; #How to help **At the suggestion of the lovely mods** in previous years, if anyone would like to help out with postage, you can do so here: [**2025 mental health bead boxes**]([URL] There‚Äôs absolutely no requirement to do so, but people have asked how to help in the past, and postage is the main thing I struggle with. It all goes into postage; the near-doubling of the postage stamp in just the 5 years I've been doing this is bonkers. &nbsp; ___________ &nbsp; So yeah. Drop me a line if you fancy one, and I‚Äôll sort it. I can also add in little personalised messages if you want to send one to a friend. It might take me a little while to get them all out; I don‚Äôt want my postie to hate me because I‚Äôve suddenly got 500 boxes in a range of sacks for him to haul away. But they‚Äôll all go out, and if you want an update on if yours has gone yet then I do keep track of how many and which ones are posted on specific days, so I can let you know if it‚Äôs gone yet or not. &nbsp; **Be groovy and stay safe** ~SaC &nbsp; ___________ &nbsp; ^(A huge **thank you** to those who've helped massively with this year's boxes already - I've been able to get a ton more boxes sorted this year thanks to wonderful donations of 1,000 postage boxes, some huge rolls of tissue paper and padded envelopes, a massive 15kg donation of beads and charms - a portion of which are in every single box this year! - and more. Massive thanks to James, Simon, Coffin & every single person who's helped with everything from beads to postage - I can't have expanded this without you <3) &nbsp;",

Signal around my way has become awful, gradually over about six months to a year, but dropped off a cliff recently. Unable to make a call anywhere in or around the house, outside the house if mates message me to say \"outside\" I'll receive it about an hour later when we're already in the pub and a few pints in. Fortunately on WiFi I can make calls via Whatsapp, but for some calls this isn't possible. Long story short, and omitting details due to rule one, a supplier of telecoms equipment that was used in many mobile phone masts is no longer allowed to do business in the UK, so this equipment is being decommissioned and this process is nearly complete. Unfortunately, for various reasons, admittedly including some supply issues, replacement equipment is either not up to scratch or is not being installed in time. Most phone networks have now decommissioned 3G entirely, and 4G and 5G are often not up to task due to the above. However, as the fault relies solely with the network operators, if you're finding you have similar issues with signal no longer being reliable, raise a formal complaint with your phone operator (you should be able to do this via an online form) and due to various laws and regulations, they must take this seriously. I already had a few free months from Vodafone just via raising a normal customer service chat, but I have now made a formal complaint and they rang me back within hours. Fortunately I was not at home so they could hear me and I could hear them! I've been given a year free on my contract by way of apology, and they've removed the terms of my contract so I can leave to use another supplier. I don't want to, I politely explained I actually like Vodafone, great price, never any issues, and other networks have much the same problem. I think only O2 is fine around here and I'm banned from O2, long story! But oddly searching online there's very little to no information about this, so I just wanted to give people a heads up as I know it's a nationwide issue and lots of people are suffering from it.",

I know nationalisation won‚Äôt fix many of the issues which afflict our train network, but this is the fourth day I‚Äôve had which has been affected by signalling issues. I have been at work all day, so I could not get an earlier train. I needed to get a train to Dorset changing through two trains in Surrey. The first was so late that I thought I‚Äôd miss the second meaning I‚Äôd miss the third. I asked the train guard what to do just to see what he would say. His first reaction was, why didn‚Äôt you get an earlier train? Well there was originally 20 mins changeover and now it‚Äôs been reduced to two minutes. Also I‚Äôve been at work so I can‚Äôt get an earlier train. He then said if I missed my advance single I‚Äôd have to refund it on the website and buy a new ticket. So that means buying an extortionate on the day ticket and then refunding my much cheaper advance ticket which I bought a month ago. I wouldn‚Äôt have done that. I would have either gone home or risked it on the third train. I hear now the office for rail are thinking of making people who contest penalty fares potentially liable for criminal offences even for just challenging the fine. I‚Äôve had to technically fare evade so many times even though I‚Äôve had a ticket every single time. But yet I‚Äôd be made to feel like a criminal even if I am not! Finally to make things better, the guard kept on going in and out of the drivers cab talking to the driver which I know is part of his job. The train kept on stalling as we got to the very final stop. I won‚Äôt read anything into this but sometimes it is very easy to‚Ä¶",

    "content": "[MEGATHREAD] Age Verification - Reddit NSFW Tags - Online Safety Act [URL] We're getting a lot of queries on this topic, and so will be directing them here. GPT has made a FAQ for us below. Given the topic, please try to keep top-level comments to **Actual Questions** rather than rants and tears. And report those that are failing in this. AskUK is an ASK sub, and we don't allow politics. **Why are websites like Reddit doing this?** Because they have to. The UK Online Safety Act now requires certain sites to take steps to prevent underage access to \"harmful content\" ‚Äî especially anything considered sexually explicit, violent, or otherwise \"adult.\" If sites don‚Äôt comply, they risk being blocked in the UK or fined. **Do I have to verify?** It depends on how the site implements it. On Reddit, you only need verify if you wish to access content it has gated, while browsing from the UK. **What do I need to do to verify my age?** You may be asked for: A photo ID (passport, driving licence) A credit card check Or verification via a third-party age-check service Some sites, like Reddit, might try to be clever and less invasive, but they still need to meet legal standards. Other sites _might_ use it as an excuse to gather more of your information. **Do all my alts I use to troll ukpf, drill, ukpol, lauk, etc, each need to verify?** Yes. Seperate verifications for each account as it stands. Using the same ID - it is not expected that one person has only one account. The name on the ID will not be communicated or stored by Reddit afaik. **Is the age verification system tied to ban evasion?** Not afaik. You're still free to utilise your free time enjoying the site as you have done. **What is and isn‚Äôt considered NSFW under this law?** NSFW (Not Safe For Work) typically includes: Pornography (real or drawn) Extreme or graphic violence Some fetish content (even if not nude) Anything promoting self-harm or suicide Not usually NSFW: Nudity in a non-sexual context (e.g. medical, educational, art) Swearing or crude humour (but it depends on context) Mild suggestiveness That said, interpretation is inconsistent - some mods/sites are playing it safe (or stupid). Reddit more specifically is using the 'NSFW' tag to determine where this content is, mostly, along with some badwords and detections. Meaning non-verified users (including mods) may struggle to view any profile, sub, etc, with a NSFW tag or containing specific signals. **Who gets my data from this?** Ideally: Only the age verification provider (and not the site itself) In reality: Varies. Some sites may only log verification status, others might store more. (reddit takes status and DOB) Look for services that use ‚Äúprivacy-preserving‚Äù verification (e.g. they check your age without keeping your ID). Always check the privacy policy. Reddit specifically only retains, iirc, your birthday. The rest is handled by its processor, in Reddits case, a US company called Persona ([URL] Yes, said company is bound by GDPR and similar legislation. **Are there risks when handing over verification data?** In short. Yes. And therefore you should weigh the reality of these risks as to whether it is a _fair trade off_ for gaining access to the content you want. But the level of risk depends what they're asking for and the implementation used. No one can give a cast iron guarantee of information safety. As always, the safest way to play is to not play at all. This said. Most implementations are minimal and as risk-adverse as can be, with more than just lip service to security (some orgs will also have accreditations, audits, etc). Persona, in Reddits case, claims a variety of accreditations and security assurances. For each service, you should look for how they intend to keep your data. Whether they have been audited and how often. And what information they want and whether this is propotionate to the objective. Though do bare in mind that for most websites, this will be seen as an annoying cost. And so there will be some price-competition going on amongst suppliers eventually, with all this entails. For some this will be the lowering of security. For others it will be pressure to resell data. Similarly, not all services effected by the OSA are equal. You _will_ see breaches relating to verification data at some point in the future, as there have been in the past. Some of it may be related to OSA-serving platforms. Some will not. Some will be because it was done poorly in-house, some will not. Just because one service falls does not mean they are all as equally culpable, or present the same problems. It depends on what they want, why, what they keep, and how long they hold it for. The more minimal all this is, the better for you. **What happens to your ID when uploaded?** You need to check the privacy policy of the site/service that you've given it to. Everyone will be different. Reddit-Persona claim to only keep the actual full ID for the persion during processing, and the face for a few days. Details about your picture for a lot longer. Reddit itself will then keep your DOB indefinately for reverification. **I've uploaded my data to some service but I have changed my mind, what do I do?** You have the 'right to be forgotten' which you can exercise. This involves requesting your data is deleted. You want to look for DSAR, DPA, or Data Protection information on the subject site. For Persona this is at [URL] At Reddit itself it is unclear, but similar pages seem to exist at [URL] **What are the positives of the OSA?** Tries to protect minors from porn, grooming, or harmful material Aims to hold platforms accountable for illegal content Pushes for better reporting and moderation tools **What are the negatives of the OSA?** Introduces outsized risks to adults relative to the benefit of accessing the content/service DPA/GDPR enfocement bodies have not historically, been particularly effective It is not certain if it will even succeed in its objective **What‚Äôs the stupidest subreddit/site you‚Äôve seen marked as explicit?** People have reported things like: /[SUBREDDIT] /[SUBREDDIT] Even /[SUBREDDIT] **What other sites have been caught up in this?** So far: Reddit Tumblr 4chan Some forums, indie sites, and adult creators' platforms Even some Discord servers have started age-gating Expect more to follow as this effects all services providing content to the UK of a certain size. **How do I bypass it?** While not something we will sticky, expect to see lots of discussion on such throughout the web. Ironically, be vary careful of schemes and advice that expects you to follow links, enter information, install software, and all the usual privacy/security risks. Stay safe. But ultimately the solution is to not browse said sites in the UK. Vertification mechanisms may also not be particularly... stringent. Ymmv. You may hear suggestions to use a VPN. Please do your due dilligence on the provider, especially if using a free one (how are they funding it?). You're likely exchanging one set of risks for another. This post was not sponsored by NordVPN. Or Mullvad. But do smash that subscribe button nevertheless. **Will using a VPN effect my Reddit account?** In theory no. As IPs are a low quality indicator of things like ban evasion (or location, but I digress). However. You do nevertheless marginally increase your association with 'bad users' should you end up sharing the same IP. So don't be surprised if you experience an increase in blocks, bans, timeouts, and similar. **How do I make sure my children don't get caught in Age Verification and VPN Scams?** Fake verification phishing schemes, and malicous VPN providers (or software purporting to be such) is likely to rise, and pray upon young people. Browser Extensions especially one should be wary with. We recommend learning how to spot them yourself, and teaching your children when you're confident - **if you've any resources on this, please share**. [URL] [URL] **Who made this happen?** Conservative government passed it, but Labour supported it too. Cross-party consensus was ‚Äúprotect the children‚Äù ‚Äî though many critics say it's overreaching, vague, and technically naive. **Is there anything we can do to stop this?** That time was passed long ago. But some optimists are sharing a petition. [URL]",

He got promoted to team leader a couple of years ago and apparently I‚Äôm next in line for role. I‚Äôm on ¬£20 an hour in Yorkshire which I‚Äôm really happy with. Anyway the team leader is weak and won‚Äôt confront anybody to do anything. He won‚Äôt even ask anybody to do their actual job. Yet with me it seems different. The thing is it‚Äôs not just me it impacts it‚Äôs the team leader himself as well. As he still does the same job as me but he‚Äôs just in charge of the shift. So he‚Äôs having me sort out other people‚Äôs mistakes, so they now don‚Äôt care if they make these mistakes as they don‚Äôt have to put them right. I have to do another job that was another departments job which I hate doing. The worse thing is the production manager is always sticking up for him. I just said to myself I can only do one job at once and I dealt with it. Now it‚Äôs gotten even worse. He‚Äôs wanting me to clean the loom even though we have a loom cleaner. The loom cleaner is confused and a bit angry as to why he‚Äôs not doing his job. He mentioned also cleaning the rods to me and I said why don‚Äôt you get the weavers to do it since they work directly with them. Then he said ‚ÄúOr we could just do it‚Äù he tapped me on the shoulder at the end of the shift last night telling me I‚Äôd left a loom on. Well it‚Äôs not even my responsibility to turn the looms off! It‚Äôs the weavers or the team leaders job! I tried confronting him and he said nothing like he had not even heard me. So I have actually complained and like I said the manager just sticks by him. I also started swearing in the office saying I‚Äôve not been trained up for 4 years to clean a loom. I‚Äôve also tried talking to the team leader about all I‚Äôve said. He just walks off or says nothing at all. Or makes up an excuse. But he won‚Äôt confront me about it, he won‚Äôt have the argument with me when I‚Äôm trying to have it out with him. What boggles my mind the most is that he‚Äôs also having to do these jobs, he‚Äôs putting more work on himself. When he was a technician he used to moan about this stuff. Like what the hell is wrong with this guy? Yes I want to leave. Problem is there‚Äôs no jobs about. Especially no jobs that pay ¬£20 an hour. I can‚Äôt just go for any job. I‚Äôm thinking of flat out refusing to clean the loom. Then see what happens? Hopefully they get me in with HR so I can proper have it out. I‚Äôm absolutely sick of him taking jobs of others and putting them on me, and bizarrely himself.",

    "content": "Do you ever go on holiday but never leave the hotel or immediate area? My wife, who like to cram about two weeks worth of European travel into a few days at times, was utterly astounded to learn from a British friend that her and her family went to a hotel in some Spanish resort type place, and didn't leave the hotel for the entire two weeks they were out there. She thought this might be a weird British thing (she's from Vietnam) but I must admit, while I couldn't do this myself, I have heard of a few people who have done this. Mate of mine went to Ibiza with his Mrs once and I was extremely jealous being very into dance music but not having managed to get there myself at that time. But that jealously vanished when he revealed they'd just stuck to the hotel and a ba[SUBREDDIT] next door. Now he's not into dance music so I get that the clubs aren't for him, but having been to Ibiza probably near 100 times since then, I am still utterly baffled he didn't so much as explore the local beaches, or head into Ibiza old town, try a few different restaurants out. So I'm wondering how common this is? Do you go on holiday and just stick to the hotel the entire time? If you venture out, how far do you go? Or does the idea of going to one place and just sticking there for two weeks (or however long) seem utterly insane? EDIT - just to clarify as it's come up a few times and I haven't made it clear. This isn't me saying \"I can't believe people like things I don't like\" - I'm not daft! There's things like camping, winter sports, cruises, anywhere in Scotland in any holiday format, that are my idea of sheer hell. But I 1000% get why people do them and enjoy them. I suppose I also get why people enjoy going to a hotel for two weeks and just doing nothing, I just find it strange that you'd fly to a different country, sometimes long-haul, and never leave the compound. And was just wondering how common this is.",

How effective will the AC unit be if I have the pipe just going out of the window without a sealing kit? Will it still cool down a medium sized bedroom? It'd only be a temporary thing until I decide I want to keep it and then I'd get a sealing kit.",

What is the solution? \"'Childcare puzzle': Which countries in Europe have the highest and lowest childcare costs?\" - euronews In the UK families could spend a whopping 75% of their monthly income on childcare, which discourages women from going back to work. Sarah Ronan once had to resign from a job because she couldn't afford childcare. Far from being a rare example, it's a story that's all-too-familiar in the UK, which has some of the highest childcare costs in Europe, and where women are actively discouraged from going back into the workplace after starting a family, because of the expenses involved. ‚ÄúLike many parents, I had to piece together that childcare puzzle to make it all work. My son was with one set of grandparents two days a week and with another set one day a week. He was in nursery for only two days a week. And then, the situation with the grandparents changed due to ill health,‚Äù says Ronan, project lead for the Early Education and Childcare Coalition at the UK Women‚Äôs Budget Group.",

He told me there was no need because it‚Äôs not a huge problem and to just do follow up examinations when I came back. I followed this as I felt fine and didn‚Äôt even realize it was swollen so I assumed it was something small. Now i‚Äôm here, and it‚Äôs gotten worse. Basically, i‚Äôve been having flank pain, and have been struggling to pee more than ever. I‚Äôm absolutely terrified. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I try to sleep it off drink water etc see if it helps but the pain gets worse. If I go to an emergency room, I‚Äôm scared of being fined or not being allowed treatment. What are the chances of this? If I do need surgery or anything like that like having to overstay, would I be charged for that? I don‚Äôt know what to do, i‚Äôm a college student and I don‚Äôt want to be banned from the country or something. What are my best options here? I don‚Äôt know if I can still get insurance and then visit a doctor or how it all works. Any help would be so so appreciated thank you.",

The paths are too narrow to park my car on it to create a narrow gap. It's not the \"done\" thing to park on the other side of the road, and I know someone would park in the gap on the other side. It's hard to gather evidence of specific cars obviously. By the time I try to get the reg they're gone! Not sure CCTV would sufficient. It's often at night too so adds to the challenge of CCTV. Is there someone I can talk to (councillor, council, PCSO etc) who would take the issue seriously without hard evidence?

How much cheaper are they, and what times exactly count as off-peak? Oh, and if my plans are fixed, would a return ticket be cheaper than two singles?

Ohhh boy, this feels like the kind of post that wants to come with at least half a page of disclaimers first. - this post is not supposed to come across nearly as accusatory as it sounds. The intent is not to go \"you're all a bunch of liars, and that's terrible\", but rather as \"some ways in which British, and particularly English, people express themselves sounds deceitful to a lot of foreigners, though it is my understanding that it doesn't come accross as such 'internally'. I am curious to hear what motives this behaviour, how it feels, and what to you guys makes it different from lying.\" - I am not talking about platitudes and standard exchanges of \"you alright?\", \" Can't complain. You alright?\" that are part of every second interaction and essentially happen on autopilot, but slightly more involved interactions between people who have at least some sort of rapport, like coworkers or flatmates. - #notallbrits, I know. Generally #notallanything, but there is an observable trend, particularly in people from the South of England. Similiarly, #notallgermans are humourless sacks of potato held together by red tape, but that descriptor does suit a good chuck of us. So, let's get into it. I lived in the UK for over a decade, and though I am now firmly back on the continent, my crowd (both privately and professionally) is rather vast and international. This means both that encounters with Brits aren't rare, and that I see a lot more of that particular means of communication rubbing people who aren't me in the wrong way. Let me give you a handful of examples as to what I mean. My best friend in the world is English, and it happens not infrequently that I'll, for instance, bring a new snack to movie night (not a homemade thing anybody has laboured over, just an arbitrary new thing I've discovered) and she'll go out of her way to say how lovely it is, knowing full well that I'll interpret this to mean I should bring it again, only then to reluctantly confess the second or third time I bring it that she's really not that keen. She cannot articulate why we need to go through the entire song and dance every time, when she acknowledges she is only making herself uncomfortable by politely eating something she doesn't like, and annoying her friends by (to their perception) lying for no particular reason. Another (international) friend was recently bemoaning the following experience: He was trying to sublet a room in his flat, and after already arranging some viewings with some people, a British guy he knew also expressed some interest. So he invited him over, they had a chat, things seemed to be going well. My friend asked his acquaintance if he was interested and if he had any other viewings scheduled, to which the guy replied he was very interested and no, no he had nothing else lined up at the moment. When my friend offered him the room, less than twelve hours later, he rejected it because he'd just gotten a different offer from a housing agency. There are similiar examples from my workplace. We employ quite a few international master students. Come graduation season, there is very open talk about looking for full-time employment or moving back to their home countries (100% acknowledged, accepted and supported in our company) - the only ones who will routinely deny this when asked directly are the Brits, even when they're literally days from handing in their notice because they just found another job. I know it's a workplace and so doesn't really matter, but why pretend you aren't even looking when the Greek girl and the Ukrainian guy one desk over are casually chatting about the jobs they're applying for with me? I get that some people are private, but why lie rather than say \"I prefer to keep my future plans private\"? A more generic example is the whole \"we should totally get together to do a thing\" business, usually prompted by the British person in the first place. Why is it percieved as more polite to feign interest in forming a deeper friendship with someone, than to just just not say anything to that effect, chat about the weather and move on with your day? As in the above example with my friend and the snacks, I appreciate it is sometimes difficult to articulate why a cultural thing is perceived as natural and right, but as a pathological self-reflection-fetishist I'd appreciate if you could give it a go. Are the above approaches broadly perceived as more acceptable than just being honest? Are they even perceived as being dishonest by British people? If not, what would make it dishonest?",

As mentioned in the title, I'm planning on saying in England for a couple months for the first half of my gap year. I'm not legally able to work since I don't have a degree yet, and I'm from Portugal, although I would love the opportunity to work. I am also fluent in English since I lived there half my childhood. My main goal is getting to know the music scene, and how it works, in person. Watching gigs, some smaller, some bigger, and making good friends and connections! Big on this. I've been eyeing Bristol, since I've seen a lot of positive comments on the music scene, but it's a tad pricey. Not impossible, but for I would enjoy knowing if there are better alternatives for a lower price. Considering I turned 18 a couple months ago, I can't afford paying ¬£3000 a month. I have a little online gig that makes me a decent sum of money, but the goal isn't to live lavishly. Basketball is also something I enjoy, but I assume there's a decent community in most big cities. Platforms like workaway were in my plans, but I've heard limited feedback, and I would also enjoy being independent. I've also heard Manchester has an incredible music scene, and Liverpool competes very strongly with the previous 2. I hope I'm not being too naive! I would massively appreciate any reccomendations",

We‚Äôve (Married couple, 32/35 M/F) lived at our current address for five years now, end of terrace. Our next door neighbour is an elderly women in her eighties. From what we know about her, she has no family or friends except an older gentleman that used to come round to visit occasionally, although we‚Äôve probably not seen him for just under a year, and a Range Rover used to pick her up very occasionally for what looked like a ride to a party when she was dressed up with a gift bag. We no longer see this either. She has been displaying some behavioural patterns which have been alarming us over the last 2 years, which I‚Äôll try to list below: - Says her TV doesn‚Äôt work, and can‚Äôt afford to buy a new one or get it repaired. However, she has parcels from Amazon and Evri almost every day, so we wondered why she doesn‚Äôt use the money for a TV instead. - She asked for us to test a fire stick she had got, and set it up on our TV first, before using it on her TV. We thought it a little strange, and didn‚Äôt want to be using it on our TV just in case, so we refused to use it. We found it odd she didn‚Äôt want us to set it up on her TV. - She‚Äôs a huge hoarder, unable to open her front door properly, and won‚Äôt let anybody into her house. - She‚Äôs out doing her bins before bin day at 2:30am. Everyone else does it the evening before or first thing in the morning (from 5am if they go to work) - she doesn‚Äôt work so unsure why she does it at this time (and ultimately wakes us up as she opens and closes her front door multiple times which is next to ours). - She called the fire brigade one Friday evening along with the police when she said she had a water leak. I overheard her on the phone to Samaritans saying her whole house is flooded and downstairs completely soaked, but the emergency dept said to our other neighbour it was very minor. She had social services visit her the Monday following to check in on her. - She called the fire brigade when she locked herself out, resulting in them having to take the window out to get into her house. We offered to help her first when she knocked at our door before calling the fire brigade, that we could try to force open the lockbox or call a locksmith, but she refused. They said about calling a locksmith too, but she was adamant she couldn‚Äôt afford it. She also has a lock box on the front of her house that should have a key in it, but she said she‚Äôs forgotten the code and said there isn‚Äôt a key in there anyway. The fire brigade sought permission to ring social services to get the code just to check if there is a key inside, but she refused permission for them to ring. The fire brigade also asked whether social had followed up following the ‚Äúwater leak‚Äù incident, which she said no one had followed up (a lie). - She said she had no power for weeks, meaning she was knocking on our door daily for hot water to wash her hair and have a cup of tea. She came round one morning to sit with me and have a cup of tea which was fine, although I do work from home and had an upcoming meeting. That evening when my husband was home, she came round to see our fuse box for the third time, and she said she hadn‚Äôt had a hot drink in 10 days (?!) resulting in me giving my husband a very confused look - had she forgotten that morning lol ? We would boil the kettle but she was adamant she wanted to take the boiling water as is, without us adding a little cold water in it first so it wasn‚Äôt so hot and dangerous for her to carry upstairs in her house. After a lot of back and forth she gave in and let us give her the non-boiling water but was upset. I said we couldn‚Äôt have it on our conscious if she fell inside and scalded herself. - Speaking of power, we went to the pub one evening during this and noticed light coming from her windows. Her kitchen light was on and her hallway light. Our other neighbour confronted her and she said it somehow came on that day. An electrician came round to have a look, and we‚Äôre not sure of the problem but it all seemed to be working fine after his visit and we had no calls from her to have hot water anymore. She also refused my electrician husband to go in and have a look at her fusebox and any faulty sockets. He did look at the outside mains incomer, and it showed there was power to her house. - She gets the free elderly bus that picks her up right outside her house. When they turn up too early or a little late, she gets very cross with them. - Our post lady once knocked and asked if she was in, as she had had a request to bring up a parcel that she missed delivery of. I said that she had just missed her and she had gone out, leaving the post lady bewildered, as our neighbour had told her she was house-bound hence why she couldn‚Äôt collect the missed parcel herself. Our neighbour goes out almost everyday. She is definitely not house-bound. I have seen her in the shop where I get my nails done, and at our local pub. - She claims she cannot afford things and comes across as frugal, but as mentioned she has many online deliveries, and shops at M&S. when she can‚Äôt get the free bus, she gets taxis. We also have a Lidl, so I would assume if she can‚Äôt afford emergency things she would shop here and not M&S. She apparently sold her London home when moved here with her partner 15 years ago. Our other neighbour seems to believe she is quite well off, and the frugality is disingenuous. - She did her bins at 4:30am a couple of weeks ago in her knickers! (We‚Äôre a cul-de-sac but not hidden at all) I unsuspectingly saw this on my ring doorbell motion sensor. - She had St John‚Äôs ambulance waiting outside for a few hours after she pushed the emergency button in the early hours of the morning. They were ringing her phone, knocking both front and back door and then came to us for help. She then finally answered the phone to him but refused to let him in. She finally came down and was stood on her doorstop crying saying she hadn‚Äôt eaten anything for 2 weeks and only had mouldy bananas in the house. I tried to knock for her after this but no answer. I went to M&S that afternoon and got bananas, tinned soup, some read meals, and milk. I knocked multiple times that afternoon/evening to no response, so wrote her a note and pushed through her letterbox that we had some supplies for her. She never responded or came to us so I gave up after a couple of days. - The people living in our house before us used to do her washing for her, saying her machine was broken. The lady had dementia, and once her son found out about it, he immediately put a stop to it. - Our other neighbour said she had met a man not too long ago following her partners death and started to move her belongings into his quite quickly. His children caught wind and was not happy, and packed up her things and dropped them back at her house. We don‚Äôt know any more on this story, only hearing it from another neighbour. - She recently says she has COPD, which her partner also died of. I‚Äôm unfamiliar with the exact symptoms - she has only wheezed a handful of times, but not when she is entering herself, or bending down collecting pinecones from our tree or when she has been gardening for hours. So perhaps it‚Äôs only happens at certain points unexpectedly? - Lately she has been sitting on her doorstep. Our other neighbour asked if she was ok and to get back inside so she doesn‚Äôt catch a cold, but she argued that she wants to listen to the birds. She has a back garden with chairs and tables. - Again, last night at 21:45 she came outside barefoot to sit on her doorstep with a torch and eat her dinner. Her garden is completely accessible and clean so we were unsure why she was eating her dinner on her lap on her doorstep when it was dark. The front is more shared and open than the private fenced back garden. SO‚Ä¶ is there something concerning going on like the onset of something, or is she making false narratives for whatever reason out of loneliness & boredom? I have been in touch with social services when she said her electrics were out, and they said ‚Äúshe‚Äôs very known to them‚Äù and that ‚Äúthey couldn‚Äôt divulge information but she knows to ring them as a first port of call if anything happens‚Äù - but it seems she doesn‚Äôt do this and instead contacts emergency services and won‚Äôt accept help from neighbours/social. Our neighbour said she‚Äôs always been the same and very performative, but even she is increasingly concerned lately. Thank you in advance!",

I'm a Brazilian IT Implementation Specialist/Manager, work for a very specific industry related to commodities, and got an offer from my company to reallocate to the UK (we have a huge client in London). I was wondering if the proposal I got would be enough to live comfortably. 50k gross + Healthcare. Living in London is not Mandatory for this opportunity, but I would have to go there every once in a while. Wife will join me later. Any thoughts or tips are really welcomed! Cheers EDIT: Thank you all for the answers, hopefully I can buy (some but no many of) you a pint once I arrive. Just got the news today that my salary will possibly be higher due to new immigration law, which is always good. Some people pointed out the lack of context on lifestyle. Me and my wife are 30+, we like to hang out only to drink a couple of beers and get back to bed later. I do play Magic The Gathering (kitchen table CMD), and I intend to take my cards with me. And I am a freaking gearhead, I love everything about cars. We are considering going to Milton Keynes, which we heard really positive things from. Thanks again for all the messages.

    "content": "Wimbledon just doesn‚Äôt feel the same anymore ‚Äì is it just me? For as long as I can remember, Wimbledon has always been the event in our house. Growing up with just Freeview, it would be the only thing on during the tournament. I didn‚Äôt understand it at first, but by watching it year after year, I slowly learned the game. Over time, Wimbledon became the one tournament I looked forward to the most. As I got older, I realised it was just one of four Grand Slams among many other competitions, and now I try to keep up with most of them. But my heart will always belong to Wimbledon. There‚Äôs something special about it ‚Äì the atmosphere, the tradition, the way the country comes alive during those two weeks. I have vivid memories of walking into Tesco during summer and seeing strawberries and cream displayed at the front of the fruit and veg section, aisles stocked with Pimm‚Äôs and BBQ bits. Even shopping centres would set up big screens so people could stop and watch a match. It‚Äôs always felt like more than just a tennis tournament ‚Äì it‚Äôs a whole seasonal moment. Wimbledon season is honestly my happy place. Things got even better when the ballot system moved online. I was lucky enough to get resale tickets one year and had the most incredible experience attending ‚Äì I even saw the Princess of Wales that day! It‚Äôs still one of my happiest memories, and I hope to go again (and maybe even to one of the other Grand Slams one day). But this year... something feels different. While I still got excited, something about the vibe felt off. Because I‚Äôd been searching for Wimbledon and tennis content on Instagram and TikTok, my feeds were suddenly full of ‚ÄúA Day at Wimbledon‚Äù influencer posts. It‚Äôs not that people can‚Äôt dress up or enjoy the day ‚Äì but many of these videos feel less about the tennis and more about the aesthetic. I get that AELTC always invites celebrities, and that‚Äôs nothing new ‚Äì but it doesn‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre the ones driving this shift. I might be wrong, but it seems like Wimbledon is slowly becoming a trend, a content opportunity rather than the iconic sporting event it‚Äôs always been. And honestly? That‚Äôs frustrating. Of course, I‚Äôm not here to bash anyone ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know what the PR strategy is. Maybe influencers are being invited, maybe not. But something about the culture this year felt different, and not in a good way. On top of that, the ballot situation seems to be getting out of control. I‚Äôve seen posts about people reselling tickets (despite the rules), meeting at the gates to transfer entry, and going their separate ways inside. There‚Äôs also a rise in people buying LTA memberships just for the sake of increasing their ballot chances ‚Äì paying ¬£25 for the opportunity. Surely the AELTC has to be aware of what‚Äôs happening? I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì maybe I‚Äôm just being nostalgic. But does anyone else feel like Wimbledon is changing? That it‚Äôs becoming more about being seen than about the tennis? Or am I being too sentimental about it all?",

I graduated from UCL with a Chemistry Bachelors back in 2022. I've only had 2 years experience as a PM in Tech and I absolutely hate being a PM. My boss never really gave me more \"official\" training like a Prince2 certification. I'm good at stakeholder management and the usual PM stuff but I wish I did more analysis work. I really really don't like Tech. It's just not for me. I started looking down other roles, a big thing for me is seeing the impact of my work and helping people, I thought that Sustainability or ESG was the route to go down so I did an IESP (then IEMA) foundation certificate in environmental management because ChatGPT said it would give me an edge (all edge and no point). I've been absolutely struggling to get into the industry. I love the idea of strategy and seeing tangible change from the work I do, I one day want to help clear pollution from the ocean, or give some countries drinking water, or develop policies that limit how much pollution (all forms) a company can make, I want to work with renewable energy companies to find the best place to set up wind farms, I want to help boost biodiversity in certain areas, I want to stop deep sea trawling, I want to help the transition to net zero. There's so much I want to do but I'm so stunted by the fact that I don't have actual Environmental/Sustainability degree or experience. Every role I'm going for I'm rejected. I want a climate policy analyst role or a sustainability research role. I'm not even sure how to get to where I want to be. I feel so lost. My friends tell me I'm under qualified to even be an analyst even though I have most of the skills but the UK job market is so rough, I'm competing with 100s of other people, some of which have actual analyst experience. My biggest wish is to work in the civil service but man is it competitive. Do I start out as an analyst to be a consultant? How do I get to where I want to be? What can I do to my CV to stand out? Who would even take a chance on me? It's coming up to the end of internship season and I don't even have that much to show. Either it's rejections/\"redirections\"(constantly)/losing the will. I don't even have enough money to do another course because I've started working part time at my tech place, it was draining the life out of me and my boss doesn't have enough clients.

    "content": "What happens if an unpaid carer is reported to social care for increasing threats of violence? This post will be a little longwinded but please bear with me. I'm 17 and I live with my grandma (with advanced vascular dementia) and my mother, her main caretaker. I sometimes help around but my mother is the one typically tending to my grandma. My mother first had to take in my grandma in December of last year and from the start I knew it would not end well. My mother is an incredibly impatient person who cares way too much about the absolute smallest things when it comes to cleanliness and order around the house. She's always had a very short fuse. This is especially bad when my grandmother is past the point where you can verbally communicate with her. As I expected, my mother lost all her resolve and started showing symptoms of burnout about two months in. This has created an absolutely abhorrent environment at home. My grandma required 24hr care from the start but caring for her has become increasingly difficult because my mom started lashing out at her and yelling at her a lot (and also just generally being quite curt with her) basically from the beginning. This, to no ones surprise, only agitated my grandmother more over time. I constantly hear them yelling and throwing fits at each other, especially in the morning. My alarm clock is basically whenever my mom wakes up and yells at my grandma. At some point, when my grandmother had already fallen out of the system, my mother decided we should put my grandma in a care home because the burnout and my grandma's behaviour (which had now evolved into screaming all the time both day AND night, constant breaking and pissing on furniture, banging on walls, ripping her clothes, trying to break the front door so she can run away, actually running away both during the day and at night, the list goes on) were too much. My mother can't speak English so calling the right people and saying the right things to adult social care and other services has been my job for the past, I wanna say, 3 months? But our social worker has been incredibly slow with getting my grandmother into a care home because of a lot of different factors (I'm trying to keep this post brief but there is really a lot of layers to this). But ever since my summer holidays have started, my mother's aggression has gone past just angrily yelling and insulting my grandmother. She's started making all these plots and schemes on how to escalate the case with our social worker, including things like arranging a situation where it looks like I've ran away from home because of my grandmother, leaving the front door unlocked at night and letting my grandmother walk out, then not reporting her missing, sending her back to Poland to my grandpa who is quite neglectful and would be a horrible caretaker, claiming she is 'insane and aggressive' so she gets put in a psychiatric ward or just , as she has stated 'just walking out with her on the street and leaving her there'. I'm sure I'm missing somethings but these are all her 'schemes' that I can remember. Now, our social worker doesn't know about any of this and my mother's general bad treatment of my grandma. But I've been really considering reporting it because, logically, if my mother is at a bad enough place mentally to consider doing this she could be considered a danger to my grandma and my grandma must be taken away from her immediately. But adult social care has been very unpredictable and from talking to them (more so than my mom who just tends to have screaming matches with them about being slow with this process) I don't know whether this would do us any good. I don't know if they'd even believe me because my mother has told them like multiple times now that I'm like experiencing female hysteria or that I'm just so suicidal and hormonal and violent that I can't make rational decisions or some shit like that. Or, even if they would believe me, maybe they'd just make us do even more paperwork and maybe the process of putting my grandmother in a care home would take EVEN longer. What if my mom just got into trouble and it didn't speed up anything??? What if they'd deem her a danger to me and I'd be placed in some sort of foster system while I'm still a minor? What if they'd blame me for not stopping her or saying anything sooner or somehow I got in trouble ? Has anyone had a similar situation happened to them before? Or seen anything like this happen to someone else? Would reporting this be a good idea? I know you are generally encouraged to report things like this but I don't know if it would do any good for anyone, including my grandma, because as long as she's at home here there's nothing anyone can really do to stop my mom from doing this.",

Since I‚Äôm not on the contract, I‚Äôm wondering if it could come back to bite me later or cause issues when I apply for my own place. I sleep in the living room, and we‚Äôre all cool with the setup. No landlord visits or anything like that. Anyone been in a similar situation?",

    "content": "DAE want to discuss and criticise the Online Safety Act? So I need to talk about this Act. It has been 2 days since it has passed and it's already caused a lot of upheaval amongst UK citizens. This situation is deeply troubling ‚Äî I‚Äôve even had to use a VPN just to bypass the extremely stringent geo restrictions. For those that don't know, the Online Safety Act 2025 - which applies to the entirety of the UK - is as follows: *\"As of 25 July 2025, platforms have a legal duty to protect children online. Platforms are now required to use highly effective age assurance to prevent children from accessing pornography, or content which encourages self-harm, suicide or eating disorder content.* *Platforms must also prevent children from accessing other harmful and age-inappropriate content such as bullying, hateful content and content which encourages dangerous stunts or ingesting dangerous substances. Platforms must also provide parents and children with clear and accessible ways to report problems online when they do arise.\"* *Here's my thoughts on why the Act looks good on paper, but is poorly executed in practice and my criticisms that I have.* \\~ Why the Act is good (on paper) \\~ I think that the intention of the OSA is beneficial and beyond important. It protects kids from having access to pornographic content, things that they shouldn't really see, and that they're deconstructing the blatantly exploitative porn industry (through no longer contributing to the exploitation, brutalisation, and abuse of women) and preventing kids from becoming addicted to and picking things up (like misogyny or treating women like commodities / objects), which is **CRUCIAL AND ESSENTIAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE.** \\~ Creative Freedom, Survivors, and Emotional Lifelines Under Threat \\~ However, from my perspective, now it's extremely difficult for me to get access to mental health subreddits so I can vent and get advice, because now, anything deemed \"mature\" or \"NSFW\" is restricted and ID-gated (including this website), and doing creative writing through these chatbots (which I have been doing for the past few months or so, but not for porn or anything like that - I use it for comfort, venting, meeting my emotional needs rather than sexual, exploring certain dynamics - giant x tiny, roleplaying based on given scenarios, worldbuilding for my OCs) and it's both infuriating and tragic, because writers and artists - websites with drawing references are also being censored - are effectively being legislated away, lumped up, and torn away who need those tools for emotional safety, comfort, creative expression, etc because they are caught in the crossfire - myself included. From what I've seen on TikTok, some subreddits like the [SUBREDDIT] subreddit - advice and a meaningful, tolerant, safe, trauma-informed space for SURVIVORS of sexual assault, are being completely restricted by arbitrary ID checks that get outsourced to third party verification firms in countries like the USA, which is just entirely backwards and poses a huge risk of data breaches, whilst also potentially goes against the DPA 2018 (\\*\\*Data Protection Act 2018\\*\\*) and RIPA 2000 (\\*\\*Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000\\*\\*). Not only that, it could potentially go against **Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights** ‚Äî freedom of expression, which this legislation may violate through overbroad content censorship. Literally EVERYTHING with the littlest of NSFW content is being censored, including **mental health support groups**, **LGBTQIA+ content**, **survivor and trauma stories**, war crimes in **Gaza / Palestine** and the newly developing **Thailand-Cambodia conflict (which as of writing this has ended),** meaning the whole thing is poorly executed - extremely. It SHUTS down victims and discourages already marginalised groups of people - whether that be neurodivergent folks, LGBTQIA+ / Queer people, people in MH crisis and those with complex trauma, victims of sexual assault / child sexual abuse / rape / child-on-child sexual assault - as well as a plethora of other groups from having access to lifelines and processing their trauma and regulating emotions through exploring dark themes - myself included. \\~ The Economic Monopoly and Late-Capitalist Consumerism: Crushing Small Platforms \\~ It really is terrifying if you think about it as well. The UK proposes to become a global technological hub whilst simultaneously building a digital iron curtain around itself. This whole thing also effectively **monopolises high-tech / big tech companies that can actually AFFORD the legal infrastructure in the first place**, whilst small companies (like JanitorAI and others), get crushed underfoot under legal pressure - I'm sure your aware that they can be fined ¬£18mn in breaches of non-compliance, which supports late-capitalist consumerism and it leans heavily towards classist logic in the form of \"eat the rich, fuck the poor\", essentially digital gentrification. \\~ Political perspectives : Echoes of Authoritarianism, Totalitarianism, Communism / Fascism, Laissez-Faire Leadership Styles, and Dystopian Narratives / Dichotomies \\~ The fact that the petition on parliament has over **200,000 SIGNATURES** and the UK government - Labour (who many see as Conservatives but in red) - **STILL HAVEN'T RESPONDED** speaks volumes about their blatantly **laissez-faire and hedonistic rulership style.** They don't care about the citizens or child safety. This may sound extreme, but the pattern is deeply unsettling: mass censorship, silencing dissent, and marginalised groups being punished for existing online. These are not just features of dystopian fiction‚Äîthey‚Äôre hallmarks of early authoritarian and totalitarian systems throughout history - and people are comparing it to the likes of Nazi Germany, The USSR / Soviet Union, China, and North Korea. It really is a slippery slope, and it eerily echoes narratives in dystopian fiction - **1984, The Hunger Games with Panem, and The Handmaid's Tale. This whole situation is honestly just giving just that, and the silence from leadership speaks volumes‚Äîand it's a silence that endangers lives.** **Not only that, it also seems to set up this whole rhetoric or dichotomy / binary opposition where you're either a child that needs to be protected or a perverse child predator - and that is indescribably absurd because it's essentially the same as \"guilty until proven innocent\" or \"suspicious until proven otherwise\", which just completely goes against the legal system we have in the UK.** **And I also hate that people are generalising those who use VPNs to bypass geo-restrictions as porn addicts - which is true but at the same time it is very dehumanising. It isn't just about porn.** **\\~** Why It Actually Endangers Children More \\~ Whilst on the topic of child predators, the OSA does very ironically the **EXACT OPPOSITE** of protecting children from accessing porn and NSFW content. This whole act, whilst the intention is great, does not distract from the fact that it increases the chances of child predators getting into spaces where there are children (because the ID verification firms aforementioned use AI and can be easily bypassed - which are deeply flawed, unreliable, and cost-prohibitive ‚Äî failing the very purpose they claim to serve), people accessing dodgy websites with criminal and beyond disgusting / criminal / illegal activity, and let's not forget how it increases the incidence of **revenge porn and CSAM** as it pushes users into hidden, unregulated corners of the internet by making it harder to spot and report predators who exploit these gaps, and by increasing stigma and silence, which makes victims less likely to seek help or come forward. Hell, even people are using **Tor browser** to bypass the geo-restrictions, which is used to go the **DARK WEB** keep in mind. \\~ Concerns for the future \\~ This Online Safety Act that has now been enforced honestly just seems like a huge legal, ethical, moral, geo-political disaster waiting to happen coded up under the thin veneer of language relating to child safety. I am deeply ashamed and appalled by the state that the government is in. And not only that, other countries like Australia and the EU are trying to adopt the same type of legislations in the next upcoming months. And it needs to be called out. We deserve better than this. We simply can't go silently.",

    "content": "Letter to MP RE: Online Safety Act (2023) This post is long. If you're thinking of writing to your MP regarding the recent implementation of the Online Safety Act 2023 you might find it useful, otherwise I wouldn't blame you for skipping given the length. I'm not 100 percent on whether this meets the rules of the sub so if it doesn't, mods please remove. I'm writing a letter to my MP about the Online Safety Act (OSA). Not that I think it will change anything, especially given the government's response to the online petition. However, I wanted to share this in case anyone else is also thinking of contacting their MP, and is curious as to how someone else (in this case me) went about it. I'm not saying the views expressed here are representative of the whole of the UK, nor that you should share them entirely. In fact some things I've raised you may not agree with, but if it does give people some food for thought about the act and its consequences, great. \\------- I am writing to you with regards to the Online Safety Act (OSA) 2023, the grave concerns I have regarding its implementation, and worries about the wider impacts on the privacy of over 60 million UK citizens. This is not to argue with or otherwise shame the Government, but to encourage a drastic rethink of how this is being enforced and express genuine fear of what the UK is becoming. To begin, I want to make it very clear that I ***do not*** think children should be exposed to harmful content on the internet - whether deliberately or by accident. My opposition to the OSA is not in any way me condoning a lack of safeguards for children online. If the OSA was genuinely intended to protect children and vulnerable adults from harmful content, and did so in a way that was proportionate and respectful of our privacy (i.e. did not amount to pure censorship, control, and surveillance of every citizen), I wouldn‚Äôt be writing this. In fact, I may have even supported the act ***if it placed significantly more responsibility on parents themselves to control what their children access online*** \\- something they should already be doing. Unfortunately, this is not how the OSA has been implemented. It is clearly *not* about protecting children or vulnerable adults, instead using them as scapegoats to usher in a new round of intrusive measures to further surveil citizens, gather data on them, and dictate to them. The act is the very definition of a false pretence. There are very dangerous consequences following the poor implementation of this act. Firstly, asking for citizens to provide identification to strangers on the internet (in this case, the third party companies outsourced to carry out ID checks) is unacceptable, and the total opposite of what we should be normalising in a free society. When we tell children not to talk to strangers etc. we can‚Äôt then turn around and expect society to wilfully accept submitting their ID and BIOMETRIC data to third party organisations so they can can access, for example, Wikipedia. Secondly, the definition of what constitutes ‚Äòharmful‚Äô content is much more nuanced than what the OSA currently describes, leading to many adults being cut off from large swathes of the internet they had previously accessed without issue. It‚Äôs also led to political censorship e.g. the blocking of genuine protest footage under the guise of ‚Äòthis may be harmful to kids‚Äô. To give another example - since its implementation, an online support group for people who struggle as a result of alcoholism, have been blocked (e.g. the [SUBREDDIT] sub-forum of the Reddit platform) behind these dystopian checks: Essentially, anything that could be considered remotely not safe for work or harmful is put behind this wall even if discussion of such things is what‚Äôs needed for people to support one another online. Taking this away could actually deteriorate their mental health and in extreme cases increase the risk of suicide. Isn‚Äôt this what you want to avoid? Your response to this is likely to be that access isn‚Äôt being revoked, simply that more robust checks are being put in place beforehand. The counterpoint to this is that people who have already been exploited and violated are now being asked to hand over their data, to risk further exploitation by third parties that the majority of us have never heard of prior to the OSA‚Äôs implementation, which leads me onto my next point: The Government have made ***absolutely no*** efforts to reassure its citizens that data collected as a result of the OSA verification is going to be kept securely, instead outsourcing this to various third parties in a ‚Äòlike it or lump it‚Äô approach. I ask: what could go wrong? The government assures that data will be kept in accordance with GDPR rules, but GDPR leaks can and do happen. A lot. This does not give any assurance whatsoever. Another risk that the OSA poses: in attempting to protect children from harmful material, it will instead push more tech-savvy children, especially teenagers, into resorting to other measures to access such material. This is incredibly dangerous. It could lead them to finding even more obscene and harmful material than they would have otherwise. Sure, I would prefer they don‚Äôt see it at all, but as parents apparently insist on leaving their curious teenage children online without supervision (which the mere existence of this bill implies), I would rather they not be taking dangerous routes in an attempt to curtail these poorly thought-out, overreaching, freedom-eroding laws. To conclude, I would like to loop back around to my original point regarding the OSA and the fact that I do not find it to be a genuine attempt to protect children. Your government already has poor form in terms of respecting the privacy of those it seeks to represent. Please see the articles below, in which your Government attempted to implement a backdoor to gain access to data about any individual iCloud user worldwide, an unprecedented overreach This led to Apple withdrawing Advanced Data Protection, which has left UK iPhone users at increased risk of data theft compared to other countries. In what world should we accept less security as a result of government overreach? I understand the common argument for the OSA 2023 will be to ‚Äòthink of the children‚Äô. Well, I put that to you, too; *to think of the children.* Would you be happy for your children/grandchildren, etc., to grow up in a society where their identities are sent to third-party, outsourced companies? In what is the biggest threat to freedom / privacy seen from the British Government? My opinion of course, but this law, if left in place, or at least not amended ***significantly***, will lead to Labour losing a disproportionate amount of votes in the next General Election, mine included. I fear that this will give other candidates, especially Reform UK, keys to Parliament on a silver platter. That is not what I, or you, want - either for yourselves, or for your children. So please, again, think of the children, and support the repeal of OSA 2023 or strongly encourage that it is changed significantly to ensure the freedoms / privacy we‚Äôve all fought so hard for. This bill is ***not*** a righteous act to protect children, the government‚Äôs lack of foresight and assurance for it‚Äôs citizens makes this very clear. Failure to act will lead to even further distrust in government, especially Labour, increased risks for children who will be taking much darker routes to access harmful content online, decreased mental health for those unable to access online support groups without compromising their privacy, and ultimately, a dystopian surveillance culture for all in the UK.

    "content": "Government response to the Repeal the Online Safety Act petition The Government is working with Ofcom to ensure that online in-scope services are subject to robust but proportionate regulation through the effective implementation of the Online Safety Act 2023. I would like to thank all those who signed the petition. It is right that the regulatory regime for in scope online services takes a proportionate approach, balancing the protection of users from online harm with the ability for low-risk services to operate effectively and provide benefits to users. The Government has no plans to repeal the Online Safety Act, and is working closely with Ofcom to implement the Act as quickly and effectively as possible to enable UK users to benefit from its protections. Proportionality is a core principle of the Act and is in-built into its duties. As regulator for the online safety regime, Ofcom must consider the size and risk level of different types and kinds of services when recommending steps providers can take to comply with requirements. Duties in the Communications Act 2003 require Ofcom to act with proportionality and target action only where it is needed. Some duties apply to all user-to-user and search services in scope of the Act. This includes risk assessments, including determining if children are likely to access the service and, if so, assessing the risks of harm to children. While many services carry low risks of harm, the risk assessment duties are key to ensuring that risky services of all sizes do not slip through the net of regulation. For example, the Government is very concerned about small platforms that host harmful content, such as forums dedicated to encouraging suicide or self-harm. Exempting small services from the Act would mean that services like these forums would not be subject to the Act‚Äôs enforcement powers. Even forums that might seem harmless carry potential risks, such as where adults come into contact with child users. Once providers have carried out their duties to conduct risk assessments, they must protect the users of their service from the identified risks of harm. Ofcom‚Äôs illegal content Codes of Practice set out recommended measures to help providers comply with these obligations, measures that are tailored in relation to both size and risk. If a provider‚Äôs risk assessment accurately determines that the risks faced by users are low across all harms, Ofcom‚Äôs Codes specify that they only need some basic measures, including: ‚Ä¢ easy-to-find, understandable terms and conditions; ‚Ä¢ a complaints tool that allows users to report illegal material when they see it, backed up by a process to deal with those complaints; ‚Ä¢ the ability to review content and take it down if it is illegal (or breaches their terms of service); ‚Ä¢ a specific individual responsible for compliance, who Ofcom can contact if needed. Where a children's access assessment indicates a platform is likely to be accessed by children, a subsequent risk assessment must be conducted to identify measures for mitigating risks. Like the Codes of Practice on illegal content, Ofcom‚Äôs recently issued child safety Codes also tailor recommendations based on risk level. For example, highly effective age assurance is recommended for services likely accessed by children that do not already prohibit and remove harmful content such as pornography and suicide promotion. Providers of services likely to be accessed by UK children were required to complete their assessment, which Ofcom may request, by 24 July. On 8 July, Ofcom‚Äôs CEO wrote to the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology noting Ofcom‚Äôs responsibility for regulating a wide range of highly diverse services, including those run by businesses, but also charities, community and voluntary groups, individuals, and many services that have not been regulated before. The letter notes that the Act‚Äôs aim is not to penalise small, low-risk services trying to comply in good faith. Ofcom ‚Äì and the Government ‚Äì recognise that many small services are dynamic small businesses supporting innovation and offer significant value to their communities. Ofcom will take a sensible approach to enforcement with smaller services that present low risk to UK users, only taking action where it is proportionate and appropriate, and will focus on cases where the risk and impact of harm is highest. Ofcom has developed an extensive programme of work designed to support a smoother journey to compliance, particularly for smaller firms. This has been underpinned by interviews, workshops and research with a diverse range of online services to ensure the tools meet the needs of different types of services. Ofcom‚Äôs letter notes its ‚Äòguide for services‚Äô guidance and tools hub, and its participation in events run by other organisations and networks including those for people running small services, as well as its commitment to review and improve materials and tools to help support services to create a safer life online. The Government will continue to work with Ofcom towards the full implementation of the Online Safety Act 2023, including monitoring proportionate implementation.
