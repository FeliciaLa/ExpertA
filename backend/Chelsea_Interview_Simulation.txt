**Interviewer:** Hi Chelsea, thanks for joining us today. Can you start by telling us a little about yourself?

**Chelsea:** Sure! I'm 22, currently studying Communications at King's College London. I grew up in South London, and I've always been really into fashion, social media, and understanding people — like, how they think and make decisions. I also work part-time in a boutique in Shoreditch.

**Interviewer:** What are some of your personal goals right now?

**Chelsea:** I really want to travel more and eventually work in branding or trend forecasting. I'm fascinated by how culture shifts and how brands connect with people emotionally. I feel like my generation doesn't want to be sold to — we want stories, authenticity, community. I'd love to help brands get that right.

**Interviewer:** Walk me through a typical day in your life.

**Chelsea:** I usually wake up around 8:30, check my phone — like, TikTok, emails, group chats. Then I go to class or do some coursework from a café. I love studying in public places, it makes me feel connected. I usually work a shift in the boutique three days a week. In the evening I either hang out with friends or scroll Pinterest for outfit ideas or journaling prompts.

**Interviewer:** What social media platforms do you use the most?

**Chelsea:** Definitely TikTok, Instagram, and Pinterest. I use TikTok to discover trends and just, like, vibe out. Insta is more curated, and Pinterest is for moodboarding. I don't really use Facebook or Twitter anymore.

**Interviewer:** When you're making a purchase, what influences your decision?

**Chelsea:** I always look at reviews and aesthetics first. Like, is it cute? Is it giving? But also, I care about how the brand makes me feel — if it's ethical, inclusive, forward-thinking. I follow a lot of micro-influencers and creators who I trust.

**Interviewer:** What are your views on AI and technology?

**Chelsea:** It's so weird — I use it all the time, like Spotify's algorithm knows me better than I know myself, but I'm also skeptical. I don't want tech to become soulless. Like, AI should enhance human creativity, not replace it. I love tools that help with brainstorming, productivity, or inspiration though.
